Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
This paper describes the planning, design, development and implementation
 of the "USNeuroNav" application with its supporting infrastructure.
 USNeuroNav is an application for mobile deviced that enables its user to
 access media, recorded during surgeries where ultrasound navigation was
 utilized, based on several attibutes specific to each of the surgery-cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Dispite ultrasound navigation providing several benefits over the traditional
 MRI imaging during surgery, and the technology required is already in use,
 the method of ultrasound navigation is not very widespread.
 SINTEF and The National Competence Center for Ultrasound and Image Guided
 Therapy, are one of the pioneers in this field and believe this method
 will gain popularity if only the relevant group can gain access and learn
 about the technology in a convenient manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
In this report the entire process of developing this application will be
 discussed, from the first say of planning to the last day of the implementation
 and testing.
 The resulting product (so far) is an iPhone application that can browse
 or search for media based on keywords, or surgery categories and locations.
 With implemented support such as a remote database for storage of metadata
 and a webserver for the corresponding case mediafiles.

Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
This report, together with the code written, is the deliverables in the
 master-level course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project, given by Department
 of Computer and Information Science at the the Norwegian University of
 Science and Technology, NTNU.
 The project was executed between August 21th to Noverber 21th in the fall
 of 2013.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The project team consisted of three members from the department of computer
 and information science at NTNU, we were given the task of developing an
 application for SINTEF that would aid in the teaching and distribution
 of knowledge regarding the use ultrasound navigation during surgery.
 Our concrete task was to develop an application for mobile devices that
 can display media such as video and images from several different cases
 that SINTEF had, and will be, gathering data from.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
We would like to thank the SINTEF for providing us this task and giving
 us accress to the software and hardware required to develop this application.
 Frank Lindseth represented SINTEF and acted as our customer contact during
 the project so an extra thanks to him.
 We also want to show our appreciation toward Erlend Dahl for providing
 his knowledge durin the planning phase of the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The team would also like to thank our main supoervisor Anh Nguyen Duc, for
 his input and valuable feedback during the course.

Stakeholders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The project sponsor and customer is SINTEF and The National Competence Center
 for Ultrasound and Image Guided Therapy, with Frank Lindseth and Ole Solheim
 as the contact persons.
 Additional stakeholders are the development team, consisting of three NTNU

Project Background and Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The National Competence Center for Ultrasound and Image Guided Therapy was
 established in 1995 and is a collaboration between SINTEF, NTNU and St
 Olav University Hospital.
 Within the center ultrasound-based navigation technology is being developed
 and used in various clinical fields in order to guide surgical instruments
 safely into the human body (similar to GPS navigation).
 One of the main challenges in order to make use of this technology is sufficien
t knowledge about interpreting ultrasound images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
SINTEF have for many years pioneered the use of ultrasound navigation during
 surgery.
 The technology they have created is already in use, but in order for it
 to increase in popularity they need a tool to share the knowledge required
 to use it.
 SINTEF believes that an application for mobile devices will enable relevant
 groups to acquire this knowledge in a convenient and maybe even entertaining
 manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The National Competence Center for Ultrasound and Image Guided Therapy collects
 unique data material each week.
 If this was presented in an easy and knowledgeable way, selected parts
 of the anonymous material can be used to teach relevant groups to interpret
 ultrasound images in an entertaining manner.
 An App for mobile devices (iOS and maybe Android) (and maybe also a web-site)
 has a huge potential in this regard.
 In addition to presenting the available material it’s natural to investigate
 the possibility for extending the app to a serious game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

Measurement of Project Effort
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The goal of the project is to increase the awareness and knowledge surrounding
 the use of ultrasound navigation during surgery.
 It will be very hard to numerically measure the effect of our project.
 Long term it might be possible to track its influence through the increase
 in use of the aforementioned technology, but our short term goal is simply
 to make a product the customer is satisfied with and believes can be used
 for its intended purpose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\size larger
General Terms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The customer has a very clear requirement that the project results in an
 application for iOS.
 In addition, the customer sees it as a big bonus if this app can easily
 be extended to additional platforms, for example android, either by this
 group, if time allows it, or by an external developer.
 For this to be a possibility, an Apple developer license must be provided,
 in addition to at least one Mac for building purposes.
 Depending on the choice of tool selection, additional licenses might be
 necessary.
 All this must be provided by the customer at the absolute latest at the
 start of sprint 2, 18.09.2013, which is when development is scheduled for
 full start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The specific tools for developing this application is scheduled to be determined
 together with the customer at 04.09.2013.
 Many tools has been investigated and tested, and prior to the meeting,
 two clear alternatives remain, Xamarin (http://xamarin.com) and Appcelerated’s
 Titanium (http://www.appcelerator.com).
 The reasoning behind this is that these two both provide cross-platform
 development and that they have the possibility of creating applications
 that look and feel like native apps.
 To do this, a separate user interface must be developed for each platform
 that should be supported, but the customer thinks that this is an acceptable
 tradeoff for the performance gain, and the native look and feel.
 While Titanium is a free tool, Xamarin requires a license of each developer.
 Both require the use of a Mac for building the application, but Xamarin
 allows doing this remotely from a non-mac.
 This is a huge advantage since we probably will get only one Mac.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
For intergroup communication we have selected to use Google Docs for organizing
 our documents, along with Google calendar for the planning of meetings
 and important dates.
 For code version control and source code management we have elected to
 use GitHub.
 Personal emails together with mobile phone will be used to keep in touch
 between the group members.
 All these choices have been made because all the group members have experience
 using these tools and the all have the features we require.
 The selection of tools we are already familiar with enables us to put more
 time into actual development and less time into learning new auxiliary
 tools.

Planned Effort
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
TDT4290 Customer Driven Project is a course that rewards 15 credits.
 The course compendium suggests that we work 25 hours a week.
 The project was started on August 21.
 and will be concluded on November 21.
 This means that it will run for 14 weeks.
 Three team members and 14 weeks brings this to a total of 3 x 25 x 14=1050
 hours.
 This is of course the estimated time we will spend, the actual time spent
 will be covered in the evaluation part of this report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Working hours: Our normal working hours will be wednesdays, thursdays and
 fridays from 9.00 to 16.00.
 These days and hours was chosen based on the group members existing schedule.
 Having three days every week where the entire day is reserved for working
 on our project is very beneficial and will enable us to work closely together
 and not be limited to electronic communication which sometimes can slow
 down the flow of information.
 Having this schedule also leaves us open to meet mondays and/or tuesdays
 should any unforeseen critical issues arise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Our working hours does not conclude when the product is delivered to the
 customer, but continues all the way until the final report is delivered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
We are planning to deliver the final product to the customer 13.
 November, that leaves us with a week to focus solely on the report.
 It should be noted that the report will be continuously updated as the
 project develops as well.

Version Control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
We chose git to be our version control system for both the textual documents
 and the source code.
 Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed
 to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficienc
y.
 Every group member has a copy of the repository locally, and synchronize
 their repositories through the server.
 We chose to use git, since this ensures that all group members can work
 on the code and report, regardless of the status of the server.
 This also means that we have many backups of the entire repository if something
 goes wrong, so the team can ensure that all the files are up to date and
 no information is lost during the project.
 It is necessary to work on up-to-date data, especially when two people
 are working on the same file, so it is important to avoid that they can
 destroy each others work without knowing it.
 Git supports quick branching and merging, and includes specific tools for
 navigating a non-linear development history.

Risk Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
To prepare for unfortunate events that might occur during the project the
 group identified risks and figured out how to solve them.
 For each risk there are some pro-active efforts, which states what to do
 to prevent the risks arise, and there are re-active efforts which states
 what to to if the risks has aries.
 The deadline is when the risk can arise.
 Probabilities for problem occurring and severity of consequences are denoted
 by H for ’high’, M for ’medium’ and L for ’low’.

Current Situation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Currently, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is the tool doctors and other
 medical personell prefer when evaluating and performing surgeries.
 The reason for this is that it is relatively easy to understand, and identify
 tumors etc.
 Recently, however, there has been several good reasons to use DS (Diagnostic
 Sonography) (ultrasound) either instead of MRI, or together with MRI.
 The main incentives for this is that DS is much cheaper, and also more
 flexible, since the MRI requires a whole dedicated room, while DS can be
 moved from room to room, and therefore easily do a new scan during surgeries.
 DS, however, is much harder to understand.
 Therefore, MRI is still preferred by many doctors, since it is what they
 are used to, and what is considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Fresh doctors which recently graduated from medical school however, get
 some training there, and therefore adapt better to the new use of DS.
 The main problem with the current situation is therefore that experienced
 doctors have no experience with the new way of using DS, and also very
 limited possibilites of learning it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\size largest
Desired Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The solution that the customer desires, is a simple method for doctors (and
 others), that is easily accessible, to familiarize themselves with DS scans
 (images and video), and to learn have to understand them, as many doctors
 now understand MRI.
 For this, the customer has planned a mobile application that will be able
 to view images and videos from DS scands, and in the future also provide
 a quiz-like game to challenge the users of the app to try to understand
 the data shown.
 The customer already has a lot of relevant data that can be used, and also
 continously produce more, so what they need is only a tool for displaying
 and distributing it, so that it is easy to find, wherever the user is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

Evaluation Criteria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The goal of the project is to increase the awareness and knowledge surrounding
 the use of ultrasound navigation during surgery.
 It will be very hard to numerically measure the effect of our project.
 Long term it might be possible to track its influence through the increase
 in use of the aforementioned technology, but our short term goal is simply
 to make a product the customer is satisfied with and believes can be used
 for its intended purpose.

Alternate Solutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Why Scrum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Scrum is an iterative planning and execution method for software developmen.
 We chose an agile model because that works well on small groups, and the
 scope and requirements for the project were not clearly defined at the
 time it had to be decided on a development model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
There ar many advantages for using scrum, for example managing risk and
 change effectively, by using small steps and quick feedback (tests, customers)
 errors from misunderstandings are quickly addressed.
 Focusing on the most valuable and most risky aspect of the project up front
 reduce the cost of failure and therefore give a greater understanding of
 risk in the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The ability to cope with changes is also one of the reason we chose scrum.
 It was not clear that we migth get an other team menber to our group, so
 we planned for three people, and with scrum we could esaly change the plans
 if we got one more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\size largest
Scrum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Scrum is an agile software development methodology.
 Scrum is based on a series of increments of Sprints, where requirements,
 design and product implementation evolve through the project lifetime.
 A Scrum team is quite small, usually about five to ten people.
 The team is self-organized, which means that all the main roles for the
 project are divided among the members of the team.
 There is usually a big focus on fast communication between members given

Srum Artefacts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
There are several artifacts used in Scrum, such as product backlog and sprint
 backlog.
 The product backlog is a list with all the remaining functionality to implement
, wile the sprint backlog is a list with functionality that is to implement
 during a sprint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The project is divided into sprints, which usually last between two to four
 weekss.
 A sprint usually consists of a sprint planning meeting where the members
 of the team and the stakeholders/customer of the project pick out items
 from the product backlog that they will try to finish within that sprint,
 and put these items into the sprint backlog.
 Each of these items will have an estimated effort on how hard or how much
 time they will take to complete.
 The istems estimated effort to complete should be updated after each day
 so that the team can see if they are on track with finishing the project
 on time or not.
 This is visible through the burndown chart, a graph which shows how much
 effort remains in the sprint at any given day.

Sprint planning meeting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
It is a meeting held at the start of each sprint.
 The team decides wich items in the product backlog that will be in the
 sprint backlog, based on the itmens priority.
 Each item in the sprint backlog will then be given an estimated effort
 on how long it will take to complete.

Daily standups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
It is a short meeting, not more than 10 - 15 minutes, at the start of each
 day during a sprint.
 Each member of the group updates the rest on what has been done since last
 meeting, what they will do today and if there is any problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\size larger
Sprint review meeting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
It is held after each sprint to review which tasks from the sprint backlog
 that have been completed or not.
 The tasks that have not been completed yet will have to go back into the
 product backlog.
 In this meeting the customer will be shown the current state of the product,
 and give feedback to the group.

Sprint retrospective meeting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
It is held after each sprint to reflect on the past sprint and to improve
 on the next sprint.
 The questions asked and documented are ”What went well during the sprint?”
 and ”What could be improved in the next sprint?”.

Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
In this section the system requirements will be presented.
 First a description of the scope of the project, then comes definitions,
 then a describtion of the functional and non-functional requirements.
 At the end the product backlog wil be described.

Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The final system is to be identified by the name USNeuroNav App.
 The system will have two interfaces, one for the administrator and one
 for users (registered and not registered).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The administrator will have a simple panel (text-based or GUI) from where
 he can register users, create new categories and cases, and upload media
 files (images and video) to cases).
 He will also have the possibility to edit categorie structure, by for example
 specifying sub-categories etc.
 This panel will be a computer program, not a mobile application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The interface for users is the main project, namely the mobile application.
 The interface will be similar to registered and unregistered users (except
 from the fact that the user will have to log in), but unregistered users
 will not necessarily be able to view all categories, cases or media files.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Both for registered and unregistered users, the app should be able to view
 a structure of categories, which contains cases.
 These cases, again, contains media files, i.e.
 images and videos.
 The app should present these media files in a simple, yet informative way.
 Navigating the category structure should be very

native
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For example for iOS, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset

 button should be displayed in the upper left corner, with a label which
 tells the user where

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
This chapter will describe the architechture of our application the way
 it was planned before the implementation started.
 It will describe the different modules of our system and through different
 architectural views show how we have planned the structure and modularity
 of our system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\size larger
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The purpose of this is to give an overview of the architectural structure
 of our system.
 This will enable the project developers to have a clear and planned approach
 to the system architecture and it will guide the implementation of the
 system.
 By being familiar with the achitecture, and knowing how every module works,
 all the developers will be able to work on the modules independently and
 can rely on the planned architecture when the system is assembled.
 This will also enable potential future 3rd parties to further develop and
 improve our system, with a proper documentation of our architecture it
 will be easier to change specific modules of our system without having
 to change the entire code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\size larger
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Chapter 6 will cover the important parts of the achitecture of our system.
 We will describe our architecture through several different views and to
 a detail that is to be expected given the size of the project.
 The logic and reasoning for our choices will also be discussed by the end
 of the chapter.

In order to illustrate the achitectural viewpoints we have decided to use
 the

.
 This is view model designed for "describing the architecture of software-intens
ive systems, based on the use of multiple, concurrent views" (add citation
 link: Kruchten, Philippe (1995, November) http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/teaching/pa
pers/4+1view-architecture.pdf).
 This model consists of four views of the system seen from different stakeholder
s, in addition to use cases (the +1), in order to accurately portray the
 achitecture of the system.

 The user then select the tab for searching.
 The application changed to the search interface window and asks for user
 input.
 The user then inputs the desired keywords before the application searches
 for all cases matching the keywords and displays the matching cases to
 the user.
 The user then selects a case and is refered to the remote webserver to
 access the mediafiles belonging to the case.
 The user then are free to stream all the case media.

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The overall architecture will be that the phone application primarly communicate
s with a PHP script at startup, to fetch the categories, cases, and also
 some references to the media files (images and videos) for each case.
 The PHP script receives HTTP GET requests, and responds to them by reading
 from an underlying SQL database, and responds to the request by sending
 back json objects representing the categories and cases, with the same
 structure as used in the SQL database, to ensure consistency.
 The reason why we need this PHP script between the SQL database and the
 phone application, is tat while Titanium does not support communcation
 with external SQL servers (only internal SQLITE servers), it does support
 HTTP communication and JSON parsing.
 When the user browses to a specific case, the app will go to a web server
 and stream the media files directly from there.
 If the user decides to cache som media files locally, the app will simply
 download them from the web server, and save them on the phone's local storage.

Data Storage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\size larger
Overall
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Since the data that will be used in this app is from real medical cases,
 the customer wanted to have full control over the data, and therefore did
 not want to rent/buy cloud services from third parties.
 The team therefore suggested that if the customer provided a dedicated
 server, the team would create the database and other necessary components.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Another important note about data storage, is that more relevant data for
 the app is produced every day, so the customer wanted to be able to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

push
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 new data into the app without the users having to download a new version
 every time.
 This will be solved by maintaining a database with the different categories
 and cases, and also the relationship between them, as well as an overview
 of where to find images and videos for each case.
 The images and videos themselves will be stored on a web server which the
 app can access and stream the data from.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Since the customer only wants part of the data to be publicly available,
 some user identification must be enforced.
 User information, such as user name and password, must therefore also be
 stored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Finally, the customer enquired about the possibility of using the app offline.
 Since the data for the app will be very large, the videos are typically
 XX MB, and each case usually have one, the team decided that storing all
 of the data locally on the phone would be too much.
 As a solution to this, a possibility for selecting some cases, images and/or
 videos, that the phone should download and store locally, were proposed,
 so that some data, that the user selects, will be available offline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\size larger
Categories, cases and users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
To store the categories and cases, and also a reference to the media files
 belonging to each case, a MySQL database will be used.
 The reason for this is that MySQL is free to use, and is also an SQL database
 that the team is familiar with, so that the development process might be
 fast and painless.
 Since there are clear relations between categories and cases, and also
 between categories themselves (sub-cases and super-cases), a relational
 database like SQL fits very well.
 The MySQL database is also the logical place to store the user identification,
 since they can be stored in a simple table with a few columns for user
 name, password, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The design of the MySQL database can be seen in the ER-diagram below:

ER diagram

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The reasoning behind this ER-diagram is as follows: A category must be identifie
d by a name for the user, and will have an id to use as foreign key.
 A category can have zero or more sub-categories, and zero or more super-categor
ies.
 Several categories can have the same sub-category, and vice-verca, to allow
 for re-use of certain categories, for example locations, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

frontal lobe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 To then decide which case belongs to which selection of categories, a case
 will belong to a tree-structure of categories.
 Therefore a case must be connected to all the categories along a path.
 For instance if case 1 is from a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

primary tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 surgery located in the frontal lobe, case 1 will belong to all of the categorie
s 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

primary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

frontal lobe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

Images and videos
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The MySQL database will only contain URL's to the images and videos, while
 the images and videos themselves will be stored on a web server, to allow
 streaming the media data directly to the phone application.
 The media files will be organized after cases, but will not contain any
 meta data at all.
 All of that will come from the database.

Architectural Rationale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
We tried our best to stick to the traditional Model View Controller (MVC)
 achitecture during our planning, this is a tried and tested achitecture
 that provides separate modules and provides us with the ability to modify
 our GUI late in the development should the customer have any change of
 mind or other reasons to modify our interface.
 Given the framework we ended up with (Titanium) and our unfamiliarity with
 the coding language (Javascript), we did run into some slight problems
 with sticking to MVC, but as we got more familiar with it, the problems
 seemed to be solved one by one.

Lyx and LaTeX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
For writing the report, the team chose to write it in the document markup
 language LaTeX [1], by using the Lyx [2] document processor.
 The reason why LaTeX was chosen is that it is widely used in academica,
 and that the team members saw this as an opportunity to familiarize themselves
 with the tool they likely will use when writing their master.
 In addition, LaTeX generates standard, good looking and highly customizable
 pdf's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The reason why Lyx was chosen for writing the document, is that it provides
 the user with an easy to use interface, that still enables the user to
 make use of all the different options with LaTeX, and that it is open source.

Google Drive and Docs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
For writing internal documents, such as meeting agendas, meeting summaries,

 The reasoning behind this is that it is very easy to use, and also that
 it provides different people to modify and view others' modifications in
 real-time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
To store and distribute files between the team members, Google Drive [2]
 was chosen.
 Google Docs is very closely integrated with Google Drive, so Google Drive
 became the obvious solution for the team.

Titanium and JavaScript
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
To develop the mobile application, the Titanium [1] tool set was chosen.
 It provides its own IDE for writing the code, which is based on Eclipse
 [2].
 Titanium is a framework for creating cross-platform mobile applications,
 where the code is written in JavaScript, and compiled to native code for
 the selected platforms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
To decide on the platform and tools to use, the team spent a lot of time,
 together with the customer, evaluating different options.
 Since the customer had very clear requirements, not many available options
 were actually sufficient.
 The customer's requirements was in short that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
The application should be cross-platform (at least iOS and Android)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
The application should have a native

\end_inset

look and feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on all platforms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
The application should have (close to) the same performance as if written
 in native code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
(The platform should be free to use if possible)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Given these very specific, and quite demanding, requirements, the team was
 only able to find a couple of valid options.
 These options were in the end Titanium, which was chosen, and Xamarin [3].
 Xamarin is a quite similar tool to Titanium, except that it uses code written
 in C# instead of JavaScript.
 Despite that the team had more experience with C#, Titanium was chosen
 because that it is completely free to use, while Xamarin requires a license.
 Several other options, like PhoneGap, Marmalade and native apps, but none
 fit the customer's requirement.
 PhoneGap, for example, have neither native performance nor 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

look and feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while writing the app in native code for iOS and Android would take too
 much time.
 Marmalade, together with Xamarin, cost too much for the customer, given
 that (almost) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

equally good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tools existed and were free.
 Even though Titanium is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

write once, run everywhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it came closest to meeting all the customer's need (when weighing pricing
 quite heavy), so it was chosen.
 If the code is written very carefully, a big part of it should be re-usable
 between iOS and Android.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
JavaScript [4] is a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing.
 It is commonly used to make web pages dynamic, but is in this case compiled
 down to native code for mobile platforms by Titanium.

PHP [1] is a server-side scripting language designed for web development.
 PHP code is interpreted by a web server with a PHP module, which generates
 the resulting web page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
For this project, PHP is used as a tiny layer between the mobile application
 and the database.
 Since Titanium does not support communication with external (My)SQL servers,
 the app will communicate with a simple script that reads data from the
 database, and sends it to the app.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The reason why PHP was chosen is that it is very simple to use for small
 scripts, and that it is well documented.

Which mentioned under 2.3, Versioning Control, we use Git [1] for versioning
 control, both for the report and the code.
 The Git server we use is GitHub [2].
 Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system.
 We use Git for versioning control because it is quite easy to use, it provides
 both a shell and a GUI, and the team members were already familiar with
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The reason why we use GitHub as the Git server, is that it is free to use,
 requires no personal servers, and that it provides a very useful web site
 to manage pull requests, issues, etc.

Sprint planning

\begin_layout Standard

During a large part of sprint 1, Marthe will be away on a planned trip,
 so the group will have to work while divided in two.
 To accomodate for this, Marthe will have responsibility for gathering all
 the material that we currently have created in Google Drive, and put it
 together into a single LATEX document.
 In addition, she is to start looking into the test planning.
 The reason why we choose to move our report to a single LATEX document
 is that this allows for better version control, as we will put it together
 with our code on Github, and also to familiarize ourself with LATEX, as
 it is very likely that the final report will be written in LATEX in the
 end.
\end_layout

Kristoffer and Stian, who will be in Trondheim for the whole sprint, will
 start on the implementation.
 To begin with, Stian will set up a raw skeleton for displaying the categories
 (hardcoded for now), while Kristoffer finnishes a demo of the GUI, which
 will be shown to the customer and the supervisor.
 The next step will be to display cases, along with their images and videos.
 All categories, cases, images and videos will be either stored locally
 or hardcoded URL's to begin with, to focus only on the simple parts first.
 Before development can start, the iMac, borrowed from the customer, must
 be set up with the required software and licenses.
 For now the only software required is XCode and Titanium Studio.
 As Titanium is free to use, no license will be required at this step, but
 might be required if testing is to be done on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 device, and not the iPhone simulator wich Titanium makes available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Since the team is quite inexperience with scrum, an additional feature is
 planned, that will be implemented if the initial tasks are completed within
 the first half of the sprint.
 That feature is loading the categories, cases, images and videos from server.
 To allow for this, the server must be set up with a MySQL server to store
 the categories and cases, and a web server (Apache) to make available the
 images and videos.
 Setting up the server with the required software, and configuring it, is
 assigned to Stian, as he has some experience with it.
 Implementing the communication between the client (app) and the server,
 will be done in cooperation between Stian and Kristoffer, as they are the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Finally a goal for the report progress is to have a skeleton for the report
 in a LATEX document, with all written material previously written in Google

\begin_layout Subsubsection

User interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
A lot of the implementation for this sprint is programming the user interface
 for viewing categories and cases, and their images and videos.
 In the early phase of the sprint, we made a GUI demo with some options,
 which we intended to show to the customer.
 However, the customer is travelling for two and a half week, so no meeting
 with him was possible during sprint 1.
 The demo was therefore presented to him in an email, and he agreed with
 our design choices, and urged us on.

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The first decision which had to be made, was to figure out how we 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

split
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the app into the three main 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that it should support, which is browsing categories, searching, and logging
 in.
 For this, we decided to use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tabs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one for each 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The reason for why we chose to use tabs, is that is the standard way to
 split a app into several functions, both for Android and iOS, and the customer
 has pointed out repeatedly that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

native look and feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is very important, and that he wants an app that looks professional.
 Tabs is easily supported with Titanium, using a tab group that contains
 mutliple tabs (three in our case).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Further on, we decided to simply use a list view to that simulates a tree
 structure to display the categories and the cases.
 To make the structure of the categories and cases as general as possible,
 a category can have zero or more sub-categories, and zero or more super-categor
ies, that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parents
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Also, a category can have zero or more cases.
 Several categories can have the same case, and to decide which case is
 shown when navigating the tree structure, we simply take the intersection
 of the cases for the categories we have selected.
 See below for a demo of the navigation:

When a case is selcted, the case's images and videos will have to be displayed.
 To begin with, this is done be simply taking the user to a view of the
 first element (video or image), and from there, the user can swipe between
 images and videos belonging to the selected case.
 We have discussed the possibility for a thumbnails view or something similar
 also, but no decision about this have been made, and for now we are postponing
 this until the customer can have his say on the matter.

Client-server communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\size large
Server side
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
As Titanium does not support direct communication with an external MySQL
 server, a dedicated component to compensate for this must be developed,
 and run on the server side.
 Since Titanium supports HTTP connections, a php script will run on the
 server's web server, and will be used to read data from the MySQL server,
 and send it to the client on request.
 In more detail, the server will answer a HTTP GET request, with a json
 list, which is built in the same way as the MySQL server, to ensure consistency.
 The reason for sending json objects instead of for example XML objects,
 is that json objects typically are smaller, and faster to parse.
 Since the MySQL server only contains references to the images and videos,
 the data sent here will not be too large, and it will allow the client
 to stream the images and videos from the Apache web server, by sending
 the reference as URL's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\size large
Client side
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
When the application is booting up, the client will poll the server for
 data once, by sending an HTTP GET request, using Titanium's build-in support
 for this.
 The client will then receive the json list, which Titanium also has built-in
 support for parsing.
 Using this data, the app will build an internal structure of the categories
 in memory, and use this to generate the tree-structured navigation.
 The json object will also contain references to where the images and videos
 for each case can be streamed from, so these will also be stored locally.

Marthe informed the group about the absence in good time before the period
 in question, so the group were able to plan with this in mind.
 The agreement was that Marthe were going to work on some pre-defined tasks

Customer Feedback
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
As the customer was away travelling during the whole sprint, all contact
 with him were done using emails.
 Prior to his travel, we decided that the sprint delivery, where the team
 show what has been done this sprint, and shows a prototype to the customer
 if possible, were to be postponed until his arrival, somwhere in sprint
 2.
 Thus, the only feedback from the customer during sprint 1 has been the
 feedback he gave on the GUI demo which were sent.
 His feedback regarding that, was that he very much liked the navigation,
 but he also wanted text on the back-button, explaining where it leads.
 This was exactly what the group intended, but that did not show very well
 on the demo.
 He also pointed out that categories would change, which will be fully supported
, by reading them from the SQL database.
 The categories in the demo were only examples.
 Other than these few comments, the customer agreed with our design choices.

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The implementation of the initial stories, viewing categories and cases,
 and their images and videos, went very well, and were done withing the
 first half of the sprint.
 The team therefore moved on to set up MySQL server and Apache web server
 on the borrowed iMac for now, to use it for the development phase.
 This also went without too many quirks, even though the team were/is very
 unfamiliar with Mac and OSX.
 Finally, the development of the client-server communication alos went well,
 considering no one on the group had touched php or Titanium before.
 As a note, the development team for the first sprint were not very comfortable
 with using Titanium and JavaScript in the start, but adapted to this by
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

learning by doing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The team is still not 100% that the right decision for development tools
 were chosen (Titanium vs Xamarin), as they feel they would be more productive
 writing code in C# than JavaScript, considering that JavaScript in theory
 does not support classes.

What went well during this sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The development phase turned out very good, given the odds.
 We had absolutely no experience with Titanium, JavaScript or Mac before
 the sprint.
 We also didn't have access to more than one Mac.
 Considering this we are very happy with how well the programming went.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
We didn't have much progress on the report early in the sprint, but during
 the last week, we really produced a lot of good content, which we are very
 happy with.
