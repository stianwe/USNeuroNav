This paper describes the planning, design, development and implementation
 of the "USNeuroNav" application with its supporting infrastructure.
 USNeuroNav is an application for mobile devices that enables its users
 to access media, recorded during surgeries where ultrasound navigation
 was utilized, based on multiple attibutes specific to each of the surgical
 cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite ultrasound navigation providing several benefits over the traditional
 intraoperative MRI imaging, and despite the fact that the technology required
 is already in use, ultrasound-guided navigation is not very widespread.
 SINTEF and The National Competence Center for Ultrasound and Image Guided
 Therapy are among the pioneers in this field and believe this method would
 gain popularity if the relevant audience could gain access and learn about
 the technology in a convenient manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this report, the entire process of developing the application will be
 discussed, from the first day of planning to the last day of the implementation
 and testing.
 The resultant product (thus far) is an iPhone application that can browse
 or search for media based on keywords, surgery categories, or locations.
 The application includes implemented support in the form of a remote database
 for storage of metadata as well as a webserver for the corresponding case
 media files.

Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report, together with the code written, is the product in the master-level
 course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project, given by Department of Computer
 and Information Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology
 (NTNU).
 The project was executed from August 21st through November 21st of 2013.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project team consisted of three members from the Department of Computer
 and Information Science at NTNU.
 The task was to develop an application for SINTEF that would aid in the
 teaching and distribution of knowledge regarding the use of ultrasound
 navigation during surgery.
 The concrete task was to develop an application for mobile devices that
 can display media such as video and images from several different cases
 that SINTEF used, and continues to use, for data collection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would like to thank the SINTEF for providing this opportunity and allowing
 access to the hardware and software required to develop this application.
 Frank Lindseth represented SINTEF and acted as the central customer contact
 during the project; many thanks are owed him.
 We also want to show our gratitude toward Erlend Dahl for sharing his knowledge
 during the planning phase of the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team would also like to thank our main supervisor Anh Nguyen Duc, for
 his input and invaluable feedback during the course.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stakeholders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term stakeholder refers to any person or organization that is being
 affected (find a quote for this, incorrect definition) or has some vested
 interest in the system being developed.
 The project sponsor and customer was SINTEF together with The National
 Competence Center for Ultrasound and Image Guided Therapy, with Frank Lindseth
 and Ole Solheim as the primary contact persons.
 Additional stakeholders were the development team, comprised of three NTNU
 students: Kristoffer Hagen, Marthe Frogner Bekkevold, and Stian Weie, as
 well as the project supervisor, Anh Nguyen Duc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Project Goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the project was to create a prototype application that the customer
 can use for proof-of-concept and further development.
 (The application had to be developed for iOS devices but on a cross-platform
 framework so that it could be expanded to other platforms at a later time.)
 The primary goal was to create a stable, professional-looking application
 with the core functionality specified, such as viewing images and videos,
 and the infrastructure around it.
 The development of the product will continue post-production, so expandability
 and versatility were high priorities, such that new features could be implement
ed at later dates.
 As the prototype is developeded further by our successors, the end goal
 is for it to aid the customer in making their knowledge and expertise in
 the field of ultrasound navigation publicly available.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The National Competence Center for Ultrasound and Image Guided Therapy was
 established in 1995 and is a collaboration between SINTEF, NTNU and St.
 Olav University Hospital.
 Within the center, ultrasound-based navigation technology was being developed
 and used in various clinical fields in order to guide surgical instruments
 safely into the human body.
 One of the primary challenges in order to make use of this technology was
 sufficient knowledge about interpreting ultrasound images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SINTEF has, for many years, pioneered the use of intraoperative ultrasound
 navigation.
 The technology they have created is already in use, but in order for its
 application to become more widespread, they must first disseminate the
 knowledge necessary for its use.
 SINTEF believes that an application for mobile devices will enable relevant
 groups to acquire this knowledge in a convenient manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The National Competence Center for Ultrasound and Image Guided Therapy collects
 unique data material on a weekly basis.
 If this data was presented in an straightforward and accessible way, selected
 parts of the anonymous material could be used to teach relevant groups
 to interpret ultrasound images in a convenient manner.
 An app for mobile devices (iOS and possibly Android) (and possibly also
 a web-site) has huge potential to this end.
 In addition to presenting the available material, there is the possibility
 of developing the app further into a serious game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Project Duration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project started on August 21st and will conclude on November 21st.
 The duration of the project is 14 weeks.

\begin_layout Subsection
Project Plan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Measurement of project effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the project was to aid our customer in making their knowledge
 and expertise in the field of ultrasound navigation publicly available.
 This was achieved by creating an application that worked as a foundation
 for further development.
 The application delivered does provide the basic tools to publicly share
 some of the knowledge, but mainly it was meant as a modular expandable
 prototype that our customer could develop further into an ideal product
 for their purpose.
 The project effect can be measured in two ways.
 First, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

as-is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 upon delivery, it can be used internally to share and provide easy access
 to case information and media on mobile devices.
 It also functions as a proof-of-concept that a mobile application is a
 good method of sharing knowledge publicly.
 Secondly, it can be expanded with new features and funtionality, as it
 has been created on a modular platform with options for expansion and good
 documentation to ensure our successors will know what they are working
 with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
General terms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The customer had a very definite requirement that the project result in
 a mobile application for iOS.
 In addition, the customer saw it as a bonus if this app could easily be
 extended to additional platforms, for example Android, either by this group,
 if time should allow, or by another developer.
 For this to be a possibility, an Apple developer license had to be procured,
 in addition to at least one Mac for code-building purposes.
 Depending on the choice of platforms, additional licenses could be necessary.
 All this had to be provided by the customer by the beginning of sprint
 2, which was when programming was scheduled to begin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specific tools for developing this application were scheduled to be
 determined together with the customer on 04.09.2013.
 Many frameworks had been investigated and tested, and prior to the meeting,
 two clear alternatives remained, Xamarin
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "xamarin"

\end_inset

 and Appcelerated’s Titanium
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "appcelerator"

\end_inset

.
 Both alternatives provided cross-platform development had the possibility
 of creating applications that look and feel like native applications.
 In order to make the applcation look and feel native, a separate user interface
 would have to be developed for each platform, but the customer thought
 that this was an acceptable tradeoff, sacrificing some development time
 for the option for cross-platform possibility.
 While Titanium is a free tool, Xamarin requires a license for each developer.
 Both require the use of a Mac for building the application, but Xamarin
 allows doing this remotely.
 This could prove a significant advantage, since accessibility to Mac computers
 was limited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Planned effort
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TDT4290 Customer Driven Project is a course that rewards 15 credits.
 The course compendium suggests that we work 25 hours each week.
 The project was started on August 21 and will conclude on November 21,
 which entails a run-time of 14 weeks.
 Three team members working 25 hours each week for 14 weeks brought this
 to a total of (3 x 25 x 14=) 1050 hours.
 While the actual time spent is covered in the evaluation section of the
 following report, this (1050 hours) was a working estimate that was suitable
 for our purposes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regular working hours were Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 9.00 to
 16.00; these were the times that best coincided with the three team members'
 existing schedules.
 Three full days each week reserved for working on the project was advantageous
 in that it allowed for greater communication and cooperation than trying
 to collaborate over the internet.This schedule also left the possibility
 to meet Mondays and/or Tuesdays should any unforeseen critical issues have
 arisen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our working hours did not conclude when the product was delivered to the
 customer, but continued until the final report was delivered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plan was to deliver the final product to the customer on the 13th of
 November.
 This would leave us with a week to focus solely on the report.
 It should be noted that the report has been continuously updated as the
 project developed as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Schedule of result
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scrum is being used for the development phase.
 After each sprint there will be a delivery, and all of these deliveries
 should contribute towards a working system.
 21th of Nowember will be the final presentation, so the product and report
 have to be finnished befor that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Work breakdown structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the August 21st the group met the customer for the first time and started
 working.
 The planning and pre-study phase was planned to last for four weeks, since
 we knew early on that we did not have the required equipment (Mac).
 The planning phase included planning the project, requirements specification,
 risk analysis, design of GUI and architecture.
 The pre-study phase included planning, management and researching the technolog
ies needed for the project.
 The group planned to have 4 sprints of 2 weeks' duration each.
 Four sprints fit perfectly into the time limit, and by this plan, work
 efficiency would be maximized.
 Each sprint included a planning phase, an implementation phase, and a testing
 phase.
 The table below gives an general outline of the sprints.

This section will discuss the organization of the group, and the reasoning

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the beginning of the project, we had a quick discussion of each group
 member’s previous experience, skills and interests.
 This became the basis for role assignments, so that each group member's
 strengths were best utilized.
 The group members' individual strengths are showed in the table below.

\begin_layout Standard
Since the group only consisted of three people, each group member was responsibl
e for more than one role.
 The roles were assigned based on the strength table, and a couple of other
 factors.
 Stian, for example, was assigned as test manager at the beginning, but
 was busy with development at the core of the test phase, so Kristoffer
 eventually took over that role.
 Stian ultimately took responsibility for Kristoffer's administrative assitant
 role, resulting in an exchange of roles between them.

Risk Management

To prepare for contingencies that might occur during the project, the group
 identified risks and potential plans to solve them.
 For each risk there were some proactive efforts, which stated what to do
 to prevent the risks from realizing.
 There were also reaactive efforts which stated what to do if the risks
 had occurred.
 The deadline indicates the time period in which each potential risk could
 have occured.
 Probability of each risk's occurence, and the severity of its consequences,
 are denoted by H for ’high’, M for ’medium’ and L for ’low’.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Supervisor interaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The meetings with the advisor would be held on Wednesdays at 09:30 at the
 start of the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From September 20 and onwards, meetings would be held on Fridays at 12:15.
 This is because our sprints start on Wednesdays, so it would be more convenient
 to have it in the middle of a sprint, as opposed to the start, when we
 have more questions and challenges.
 It is also easier to come on track during the development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The meetings would last an hour, or as long as needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The minutes for the meeting were to be created the same day as the meeting.

\begin_layout Standard
This section contains a description of all the tools and technologies used
 during the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Report writing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Lyx and LaTeX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team chose to compose the report in the document markup language LaTeX
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "latex-project"

\end_inset

, by using the Lyx document processor
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lyx"

\end_inset

.
 LaTeX was chosen because it is widely used in academia, and the team members
 saw this as an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the tool they
 likely will use in composing their masters.
 In addition, LaTeX generates standard, aesthetically-appealing, and highly
 customizable pdf's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason why Lyx was chosen for writing the document, is that it provides
 the user with an easy-to-use interface that still enables the user to make
 use of all the different possibilities with LaTeX.
 Another reason was that it is open-source.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Google Drive and Docs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To write internal documents, such as meeting agendas, meeting summaries,
 and temporal plans and documents, Google Docs
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "google docs"

\end_inset

 was utilized.
 The reasoning behind this is that it is very simple to use, and also that
 it allows different people to modify and view others' modifications in
 real-time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To store and distribute files between the team members, Google Drive
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "google drive"

\end_inset

 was utilized.
 Google Docs is very closely integrated with Google Drive, so Google Drive
 was the obvious solution for the team.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Violet UML editor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Violet UML editor
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "violetumleditor"

\end_inset

 is a cross-platform, easy to learn and use, UML editor, which draws nice
 and standard looking UML diagrams.
 It was chosen because it seemed simpler and more light-weight that other
 similar tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this project, Violet UML editor was used to draw the use case diagrams,
 sequence diagrams and class diagram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Visual ER
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Visual ER
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VisualER"

\end_inset

 is a very simple Java based tool to create ER diagrams.
 The team used Visual ER because it was developed by NTNU students, is very
 simple to use, and because we have had good experiences with it from other
 courses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
GanttProject
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GanttProject
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ganttproject"

\end_inset

 is a cross-platform desktop tool for project scheduling and management.
 It gives the ability to create Gantt chart, work breakdown structure, draw
 dependencies between the tasks, and define milestones.
 It can also assign human resources to work on tasks.
 We chose this because it looked simple to use, had all the functionality
 we needed and it drew a decent locking Gantt chart.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Balsamiq mockups 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Balsamiq
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "balsamiq"

\end_inset

 mockups is a tool for creating GUI mockups.
 It enabled us to quickly create our initial GUI and then easily modify
 it as we, or the customer, felt any changes were needed or had another
 improvement that needed to be made.
 We chose Balsamiq mockups because it had a free trial period, had support
 for creating iPhone GUIs and offered a simple, intuitive and easy to learn
 interface for creating and modifying GUI drafts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Administration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many of these choices were made because all the group members had experience
 using these tools and they all provided the features we required.
 The selection of familiar tools enabled us to put more time into actual
 development and less time into learning new auxiliary tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Facebook 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For distributing information and Internet URLs between team members, Facebook
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "facebook"

\end_inset

 was used.
 The group maintained a private group where information was posted on the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In addition, the Facebook's chat function was used for instant messaging
 between team members.
 As a second option we all shared our personal mobile phone numbers so that
 we could get in touch in cases of urgency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason that the team used Facebook was that all team members had experience
 with Facebook, and were accustomed to checking it regularly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
TeamViewer 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To utilize a Mac, the team had remote access to one of the customer's own
 iMacs.
 The team used TeamViewer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "teamviewer"

\end_inset

, a simple software for controlling computers remotely over the Internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team used TeamViewer, because it was free to use (non-comercially),
 easy to set up, and the team members already had some experience with it.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Rally
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rally
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rally"

\end_inset

 is a cloud-based solution for managing the agile development lifecycle,
 such as assigning user stories/tasks to sprints and developers.
 We chose to use Rally because it is relatively easy to use, and because
 it is free for students.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Development
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Titanium and JavaScript
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To develop the mobile application, the Titanium tool set was chosen.
 It provides its own IDE, Titanium Studio, for writing the code, which is
 based on Eclipse
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "eclipse"

\end_inset

.
 Titanium is a framework for creating cross-platform mobile applications,
 where the code is written in JavaScript, and compiled to native code for
 the selected platforms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To decide on the platform and tools to use, the team spent a lot of time,
 together with the customer, evaluating different options.
 Since the customer had very specific requirements, not many available options
 were sufficient.
 The customer's requirements were, in short, as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The application should be cross-platform (at least iOS and Android)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The application should have a native 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

look and feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on all platforms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The application should have (close to) the same performance as if written
 in native code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(The platform should be free to use if possible)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these very specific, and quite demanding, requirements, the team was
 only able to find a couple of legitimate options.
 Ultimately, these options consisted of Titanium, which was chosen, and
 Xamarin.
 Xamarin is a tool similar to Titanium, except that it uses code written
 in C# instead of JavaScript.
 Despite the fact that the team had more experience with C#, Titanium was
 chosen because it is completely free to use, while Xamarin requires a license.
 Several other options, like PhoneGap, Marmalade and other native apps were
 evaluated, but none fit the customer's requirement.
 PhoneGap, for example, had neither native performance nor 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

look and feel,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while writing the app in native code for iOS and Android would take too
 much time.
 Marmalade, together with Xamarin, cost too much for the customer, given
 that nearly-comparable tools existed and were free.
 Even though Titanium is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

write once, run everywhere,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it came closest to meeting all the customer's needs (weighing pricing quite
 heavily), so it was chosen.
 If the code was written carefully, a significant part of it should be re-usable
 between iOS and Android.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JavaScript
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JavaScript"

\end_inset

 is a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing.
 It is commonly used to make web pages dynamic, but in this case is compiled
 down to native code for mobile platforms by Titanium.

\begin_layout Paragraph
PHP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PHP
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "php"

\end_inset

 is a server-side scripting language designed for web development.
 PHP code is interpreted by a web server with a PHP module, which generates
 the resulting web page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this project, PHP was used as a tiny layer between the mobile application
 and the database.
 Since Titanium does not support communication with external (My)SQL servers,
 the app would communicate with a simple script that reads data from the
 database and sends it to the app.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason that PHP was chosen was that it is very simple to use for small
 scripts, and that it is well-documented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
JSON
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "json"

\end_inset

 is a lightweight data-interchange format, which is easy for both humans
 and computers to read/parse and write.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this project, JSON was used for the communication between the PHP script
 and the mobile applications.
 The JSON objects themselves were structured exactly the same as internally
 in the database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason that JSON is used for this communication was that it is very
 well-supported in both PHP and JavaScript, and is simple to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
MySQL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MySQL
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mysql"

\end_inset

 is a very well-known SQL database, and, in their own words, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the world's most popular open source database.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MySQL was used on this project for storing the categories, and their relations
 (sub-categories and super-categories), the cases, and information about
 each case (e.g., which categories it belonged to), and URLs to the cases'
 media files.
 In addition, the MySQL database stored all user information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason that the team used MySQL was that it is free to use.
 Additionally, all team members have had prior experience with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Apache HTTP Server
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apache
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "apache"

\end_inset

 is a very common web server.
 It is free to use, very easy to set up, and works very well with PHP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Apache HTTP Server was used in this project to host the media files
 for the cases, and also to host the PHP script (see above).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Java
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Java
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Java_(programming_language)"

\end_inset

 is a concurrent, class-based and object-oriented programming language that
 is designed to run on as many platforms as possible.
 We chose to use Java to develop the admin tool, mainly because of the cross-pla
tform feature, but also because all the team members have programmed in
 Java before, and it was the language all the team members were most comfortable
 with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Eclipse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eclipse is a multi-language integrated development environment (IDE).
 It is very suitable for Java development, and it also has an integrated
 Git tool.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We chose to use Eclipse for Java development because it is easy to use,
 but it also has many handy functions.
 All team members was also more familiar with Eclipse, than for example,
 NetBeans.
 Pure text editors like Notepad++, vim, Emacs, etc.
 were also considered, but ruled out, due to their lack of auto-completion
 of code, which both Eclipse and NetBeans support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version control 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Git and GitHub
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used Git
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Git-scm"

\end_inset

 for version control, both for the textual documents and source code.
 The Git server we used is GitHub
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Github"

\end_inset

.
 Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system.
 We use Git for version control because it is simple to use, it provides
 both a shell and a GUI, and the team members were already familiar with
 it, as opposed to, for example, SVN 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "subversion"

\end_inset

.
 Git is also much faster than SVN, and provides better auditing of branch
 and merge events
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "svnvsgit"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason why we used GitHub as the Git server, is that it was free to
 use, required no personal servers, and that it provided a very useful web
 site to manage pull requests, issues, etc.
 The project's GitHub repository may be found at http://Github.com/stianwe/USNeur
oNav.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Git every group member had a copy of the repository locally, and synchroniz
ed their repositories through the server.
 We chose to use Git because it ensured that all group members could work
 on the code and report, regardless of the status of the server.
 This also meant that we had many backups of the entire repository if something
 went wrong, so the team can ensure that all the files are up-to-date and
 no information was lost during the project.
 It is necessary to work on up-to-date data, especially when two people
 are working on the same file; it was important to ensure that they didn't
 inadvertently destroy one another's work.
 Git supports quick branching and merging, and includes specific tools for
 navigating a non-linear development history.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Coding Conventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When writing code, we decided on a couple of coding conventions, to make
 the code readable and more easy to understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Names
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When writing ordinary names of variables, functions, classes, etc., camel
 case was used.
 Camel case means that the word is not divided by space, but each new word
 starts with an upper case character.
 Example: ThisIsAnExampleOfCamelCase.
 Constants, on the other hand, were written with all uppercase characters,
 with underscore to separate words.
 See table below for details.

\begin_layout Subsection
Current Situation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is the tool doctors and other
 medical personnel prefer in pre-operative evaluation.
 The reason for this is that it is relatively easy to understand, and also
 to identify tumors and other potential medical obstacles.
 The figure below shows a typical MRI machine.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

Recently, however, there has been speculation on the use of DS (Diagnostic
 Sonography) (ultrasound) either instead of MRI, or together with MRI.
 The main incentive for this is that DS is much cheaper, and also more flexible,
 since the MRI requires its own dedicated room, while DS is mobile and can
 be moved from room to room.
 It is therefore easier to perform a new intraoperative scan with DS than
 MRI.
 The fact that surgeons can now obtain real-time updates on what the conditions
 inside the body are, is extremely advantageous.
 As an example, DS can determine whether there are any remnants of a tumor
 still inside the body.
 On the other hand, DS is much harder to understand.
 Therefore, MRI is still preferred by many doctors, since it is what they
 accustomed to and familiar with.
 Younger doctors who have only recently graduated from medical school do
 get some training there, and therefore are more adaptable to the new use
 of DS.
 The main problem with the current situation is simply that experienced
 doctors have no understanding of the new way of using DS, and, unfortunately,
 very few opportunities to learn how to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure below shows a typical image from an surgical operation.
 The leftmost image is an MRI, and the middle image is an ultrasound of
 the area represented by the rectangle in the leftmost image.
 The rightmost image is a skull with a representation of where the images

Desired Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution that the customer desires, is a simple method for doctors (and
 others), that is easily accessible, to familiarize themselves with DS scans
 (images and video), and to learn have to understand them, as many doctors
 now understand MRI.
 For this, the customer has planned a mobile application that will be able
 to view images and videos from DS scans, and in the future also provide
 a quiz-like game to challenge the users of the app to try to understand
 the data shown.
 The customer already has a lot of relevant data that can be used, and also
 continuously produce more, so what they need is only a tool for displaying
 and distributing it, so that it is easy to find, wherever the user is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Alternate Solutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some similar solutions for the USNeuroNav App.
 Some is available for everyone, and some is only for surgeons and internal
 staff.
 Consideration should be given to privacy, therefore not all systems are

\begin_layout Subsection
The Waterfall Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The waterfall model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Waterfall Model design"

\end_inset

 is a linear-sequential life cycle model, in which progress is seen as flowing
 steadily downwards through the phases, like a waterfall.
 Any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase
 is complete, the phases do not overlap.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

The figure below illustrates how the waterfall phases are organized.

Waterfall Model
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

The waterfall model is simple and easy to understand and use, the outcome
 of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood,
 and with it's clearly defined stages it is easy to arrange tasks, it's
 easy to understand milestones and the process and results are well documented.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The disadvantages with the waterfall model are that no working software
 is produced until late during the life cycle.
 It cannot accommodate changing requirements, and generally handles all
 changes poorly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scrum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scrum is an iterative planning and execution method for software development.
 Scrum is agile and based on a series of increments of Sprints, where requiremen
ts, design and product implementation evolve through the project lifetime.
 A Scrum team is quite small, usually about five to ten people.
 The team is self-organized, which means that all the main roles for the
 project are divided among the members of the team.
 There is usually a big focus on fast communication between members given
 that scrum teams are usually small.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

In the figure below the scrum lifecycle is shown.
 A description of these elements are given in section 4.4 Scrum Artefacts.

\begin_layout Standard
There are many advantages for using scrum, for example managing risk and
 change effectively, by using small steps and quick feedback (tests, customers)
 errors from misunderstandings are quickly addressed.
 Focusing on the most valuable and most risky aspect of the project up front
 reduce the cost of failure and therefore give a greater understanding of
 risk in the project.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is clearly that the waterfall model could not be to our benefit, so we
 chose an agile model.
 It works well on small groups, and the scope and requirements for the project
 were not clearly defined at the time it had to be decided on a development
 model.
 We also did not know exactly when we would get an iMac form the customer,
 so an agile lifecycle model was preferable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to cope with changes was the major reason for why we chose scrum.
 It was not clear that we might get another team member to our group, so
 we planned for three people, and with scrum we could easily change the
 plans if we got one more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scrum Artefacts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several artifacts used in Scrum, such as product backlog and sprint
 backlog.
 The product backlog is a list with all the remaining functionality to implement
, while the sprint backlog is a list with functionality that is to implement
 during a sprint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project is divided into sprints, which usually last between two to four
 weeks.
 A sprint usually consists of a sprint planning meeting where the members
 of the team and the stakeholders/customer of the project pick out items
 from the product backlog that they will try to finish within that sprint,
 and put these items into the sprint backlog.
 Each of these items will have an estimated effort on how hard or how much
 time they will take to complete.
 The items estimated effort to complete should be updated after each day
 so that the team can see if they are on track with finishing the project
 on time or not.
 This is visible through the burndown chart, a graph which shows how much
 effort remains in the sprint at any given day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pair programming is an agile software development technique which we would
 try to take advantage of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scrum Meetings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several different meeting in the scrum lifecycle that we used:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sprint planning meeting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a meeting held at the start of each sprint.
 The team decides which items in the product backlog that will be in the
 sprint backlog, based on the items priority.
 Each item in the sprint backlog will then be given an estimated effort
 on how long it will take to complete.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Daily standups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a short meeting, not more than 10 - 15 minutes, at the start of each
 day during a sprint.
 Each member of the group updates the rest on what has been done since last
 meeting, what they will do today and if there are any problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sprint review meeting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is held after each sprint to review which tasks from the sprint backlog
 that have been completed or not.
 The tasks that have not been completed yet will have to go back into the
 product backlog.
 In this meeting the customer will be shown the current state of the product,
 and give feedback to the group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sprint retrospective meeting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is held after each sprint to reflect on the past sprint and to improve
 on the next sprint.
 The questions asked and documented were: ”What went well during the sprint?”
 and ”What could be improved in the next sprint?”.

\begin_layout Section
Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section the system requirements will be presented.
 First a description of the scope of the project, followed by the actors,
 then a description of the functional and non-functional requirements.
 At the end the product backlog will be described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final system is to be identified by the name USNeuroNav App.
 The system will have two interfaces, one for the administrator and one
 for users (registered and not registered).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The administrator will have a simple panel (text-based or GUI) from where
 he can register users, create new categories and cases, and upload media
 files (images and video) to cases).
 He will also have the possibility to edit the category structure, by for
 example specifying sub-categories etc.
 This panel will be a computer program, not a mobile application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interface for users is the main project, namely the mobile application.
 The interface will be similar to registered and unregistered users (except
 from the fact that the user will have to log in), but unregistered users
 will not necessarily be able to view all categories, cases or media files.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For both registered and unregistered users, the app should be able to view
 a structure of categories, which contains cases.
 These cases, again, contains media files, i.e.
 images and videos.
 The app should present these media files in a simple, yet informative way.
 Navigating the category structure should be very

.
 For example for iOS, a

 button should be displayed in the upper left corner, with a label which
 tells the user where

\end_inset

 actually is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Actors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Unregistered user
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a public user who is interested in learning about the ultrasound
 images and how to interpret them.
 There may be students, doctors or anyone who wants access to such information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Registered users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is users within the organization.
 They have an interest of learning how to interpret ultrasound images, so
 they can know that all the cancer is removed during an operation.
 These users may be students as well as doctors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Administrator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the user with authority to access the administration panel in the
 application.
 The administrator can manage the application by using interface made for
 that purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Use Cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A use case is a software and system engineering term that describes how
 a user uses a system to accomplish a particular goal.

key "usecaseDef"

\end_inset

 The following textual use cases display how the users, or actors, interact
 with the system in order to achieve a specific goal, or objective.
 By creating good use cases we put ourselves in a good spot for defining
 the system's requirements.
 These use cases was created based on several meetings with the customer
 during the initial phase of the project.

Functional Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the previous section on use cases we constucted a concrete list
 with both the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
 All the requirements are assigned one out of four possible priority value:
 critical, high, medium and low.
 Critical prioritized requirements are the most important and the system
 will not be approved if it's not implemented.
 High prioritized requirements are important for the customer, but these
 requirements will be implemented after the critical prioritized requirements.
 Medium prioritized requirements are not that important for the customer
 as the critical and high prioritized requirements, and will be implemented
 after the implementation of high prioritized requirements.
 Low prioritized requirements are

, but it's not important for the customer, and these requirements will only
 be fulfilled only if there is time left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tables below contains an overall description of the functional requirements,
 its priorities and the identification we will use later for reference.

\begin_layout Section
Software Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will describe the architecture of our application the way it
 was planned before the implementation started.
 It will describe the different modules of our system and through different
 architectural views show how we have planned the structure and modularity
 of our system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this is to give an overview of the architectural structure
 of our system.
 This will enable the us to have a clear and planned approach to the system
 architecture and will guide the implementation of the system.
 By being familiar with the architecture, and knowing how every module works,
 all the current, and future, developers will be able to work on the modules
 independently and can rely on the planned architecture when the system
 is assembled.
 This will also aid future 3rd parties to further develop and improve our
 system, with the proper documentation of our architecture it will be easier
 to change specific modules of our system without having to change the entire
 code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 6 will cover the important parts of the architecture of our system.
 We will describe our architecture through several different views and to
 a detail that is to be expected given the size of the project.
 The logic and reasoning for our choices will also be discussed by the end
 of the chapter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Storage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Overall
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the data that will be used in this app is from real medical cases,
 the customer wanted to have full control over the data, and therefore did
 not want to rent/buy cloud services from third parties.
 The team therefore suggested that if the customer provided a dedicated
 server, the team would create the database and other necessary components.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important note about data storage, is that more relevant data for
 the app is produced every day, so the customer wanted to be able to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

push
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 new data into the app without the users having to download a new version
 every time.
 This will be solved by maintaining a database with the different categories
 and cases, and also the relationship between them, as well as an overview
 of where to find images and videos for each case.
 The images and videos themselves will be stored on a web server which the
 app can access and stream the data from.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the customer only wants part of the data to be publicly available,
 some user identification must be enforced.
 User information, such as user name and password, must therefore also be
 stored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the customer enquired about the possibility of using the app offline.
 Since the data for the app will be very large, the videos are several mega
 bytes, and each case usually have one, the team decided that storing all
 of the data locally on the phone would be too much.
 As a solution to this, a possibility for selecting some cases, images and/or
 videos, that the phone should download and store locally, were proposed,
 so that some data, that the user selects, will be available offline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Categories, cases and users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To store the categories and cases, and also a reference to the media files
 belonging to each case, a MySQL database will be used.
 The reason for this is that MySQL is free to use, and is also an SQL database
 that the team is familiar with, so that the development process becomes
 efficient.
 Since there are clear relations between categories and cases, and also
 between categories themselves (sub-cases and super-cases), a relational
 database like SQL fits very well.
 The MySQL database is also the logical place to store the user identification,
 since they can be stored in a simple table with a few columns for user
 name, password, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The design of the MySQL database can be seen in the ER-diagram below:

ER diagram
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reasoning behind this ER-diagram is as follows: A category must be identifie
d by a name for the user, and will have an id to use as foreign key.
 A category can have zero or more sub-categories, and zero or more super-categor
ies.
 Several categories can have the same sub-category, and vice-verca, to allow
 for re-use of certain categories, for example locations, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

frontal lobe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 To then decide which case belongs to which selection of categories, a case
 will belong to a tree-structure of categories.
 Therefore a case must be connected to all the categories along a path.
 For instance if case 1 is from a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

primary tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 surgery located in the frontal lobe, case 1 will belong to all of the categorie
s 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

primary tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

frontal lobe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Images and videos
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MySQL database will only contain URL's to the images and videos, while
 the images and videos themselves will be stored on a web server, to allow
 streaming the media data directly to the phone application.
 The media files will be organized after cases, but will not contain any
 meta data at all.
 All of that will come from the database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Selections of Architectural Viewpoints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to illustrate the architectural viewpoints we have decided to use
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

4+1 architectural view model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This is view model designed for "describing the architecture of software-intens
ive systems, based on the use of multiple, concurrent views".
 This model consists of four views of the system seen from different stakeholder
s, in addition to use cases (the +1), in order to accurately portray the
 architecture of the system.

\begin_layout Standard
The overall architecture will be that the phone application primarly communicate
s with a PHP script at startup, to fetch the categories, cases, and also
 some references to the media files (images and videos) for each case.
 The PHP script receives HTTP GET requests, and responds to them by reading
 from an underlying SQL database, and responds to the request by sending
 back json objects representing the categories and cases, with the same
 structure as used in the SQL database, to ensure consistency.
 The reason why we need this PHP script between the SQL database and the
 phone application, is tat while Titanium does not support communcation
 with external SQL servers (only internal SQLITE servers), it does support
 HTTP communication and JSON parsing.
 When the user browses to a specific case, the app will go to a web server
 and stream the media files directly from there.
 If the user decides to cache som media files locally, the app will simply
 download them from the web server, and save them on the phone's local storage.

 The user then select the tab for searching.
 The application changed to the search interface window and asks for user
 input.
 The user then inputs the desired keywords before the application searches
 for all cases matching the keywords and displays the matching cases to
 the user.
 The user then selects a case and is refered to the remote webserver to
 access the mediafiles belonging to the case.
 The user then are free to stream all the case media.

\begin_layout Standard
The next activity diagram, shown below, shows the flow of the mobile application
 when a, regular or logged in, user uses the search function.
 The app then starts by displaying a text field where the user can enter
 keywords to search for.
 Following, cases matching the search keywords are displayed for the user
 to select.
 The user is next allowed to select a case for viewing, or to modify the
 search.
 If the user decides to modify the search, the app returns to the starting
 state, with a text field for searching.
 If the user, however, decides to select a case, the case's media files
 are displayed, the same way as if the user was browsing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

regular
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 way.
 After looking at a case, the user can decide to look at the other cases
 that matched the search.
 If this path is taken, the user will be returned to the view of matching
 cases, as if the search was done over again, using the same keywords.
 When the user decides to not view any more cases or modify the search,
 the search function is exited.

Admin computer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The admin computer is used to add categories and/or cases to the server.
 The main functionality of it is to add new categories and cases to the
 database server, using a connection to a PHP script.
 In addition, when adding a case, the admin can add media files to the case.
 This is done by uploading them to the web server, for instance using FTP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Database server
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The database server's task is to run the MySQL server, and to answer queries
 to it.
 Either select queries from the mobile application, or inserts/edits from
 the admin computer.
 The MySQL server consists of several tables, as can be displayed in the
 sub-chapter about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Data Storage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These tables contain information about the categories and cases, and the
 relationship between them.
 In addition, a reference to the media files located on the web server is
 stored, for each case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Web server
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The web server's task is to store and make available on the Internet, the
 media files associated with every case.
 This is done by running an Apache web server which hosts the media files
 so that they can be streamed or downloaded using the mobile application,
 using regular HTTP and JSON objects.
 In addition, the web server must allow the admin computer to upload new
 media files, either for new cases, or for already existing ones.
 This can be done by using for instance FTP.
 A media file can either be an image or a video.

USNeuroNav, the mobile application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
USNeuroNav is the name of the mobile application, which can be run on smart
 phones.
 The app communicates with the database server to fetch information about
 the categories, cases, and media files.
 This communication goes through a thin layer of PHP script, that actually
 reads the database, and passes on the information.
 The media files themself is fetched from the web server using regular HTTP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Architectural Rationale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We tried our best to stick to the traditional Model View Controller (MVC)
 architecture during our planning, this is a tried and tested architecture
 that provides separate modules and provides us with the ability to modify
 our GUI late in the development should the customer have any change of
 mind or other reasons to modify our interface.
 Given the framework we ended up with (Titanium) and our unfamiliarity with
 the coding language (Javascript), we did run into some slight problems
 with sticking to MVC, but as we got more familiar with it, the problems
 seemed to be solved one by one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter explains how we performed the testing of our project.
 This includes day-to-day testing of the code we implemented, but also the
 final acceptance-, and usability test executed with the customer and the
 future users of the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Unit Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The primary goal of unit testing is to take the smallest piece of testable
 software in the application, isolate it from the remainder of the code,
 and determine whether it behaves exactly as you expect.
 Each unit is tested separately before integrating them into modules to
 test the interfaces between modules.
 Unit testing has proven its value in that a large percentage of defects
 are identified during its use.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "unit testing"

\end_inset

 Unit testing is one of the cornerstones of agile development, by proper
 use of unit testing we reduced the amount of potential bugs and created
 more reliable software.
 Because of the limited time we had during this project we didnt write all
 the unit tests before we started programming, but every programmer was
 responsible for unit testing the part of the code that he/she implemented.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Integration Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Integration testing is the next step, after unit testing, when testing software.
 This tests takes the parts, or units, of code, integrates them and makes
 sure it works the way it is supposed to work.
 It is not uncommon for units to work independently, but somehow fail when
 they are connected.
 For this reason it is very important to perform this test.
 By performing unit tests, as mentioned in the previous subsection, and
 passing them, we can be sure that any errors that appears when connecting
 units originate from the interface between the units and not the units
 themselves.
 This is a great advantage, and makes it significantly easier to fix any
 errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, because of the time constraints on the project, we did not write
 the integration tests beforehand, but rather executed them as we integrated
 units.
 For every new unit added to our system, we made sure to integration test
 every part of the system affected by the new unit, we also made sure not
 to add more then one unit at the time.
 By programming and testing this way, we made sure that the amount of errors
 were minimal at every part of the implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
System Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
System tests are executed to test the functionality of the product.
 The goal is to make sure the system performs and behaves the intended and
 expected way, and that it provides the functionality that is specified.
 System testing should require no knowledge of the inner working of the
 system and should be able to be performed by anyone.
 It involves the core functionality of the system as seen by an end user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since both unit- and integration testing only was done by the programmer
 working on the code, we decided to thoroughly document and perform system
 tests in every sprint.
 The system tests were written based on a combination of the requirements
 and the usecases, making sure to include all the core functionality of
 the application.
 The tests were mainly performed by the members of the team, but they were
 prepared and executed in a manner that could have been done by the customer
 or any other used should that have been desired.
 Below is a table containing all our system tests, the complete description
 of every test can be found in appendix ABCDE.

Acceptance Test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A user acceptance test is conducted, at the very end of the development
 process, to determine if the system meets the customers requirements.
 The purpose is to assure that the project is accepted by the customer,
 that it at the very least meets the minimal requirements set, so that it
 can be utilzed for its intended purpose.
 Its common that the inteded users of the products execute the tests so
 that the customer can be sure that the product safisfies its potential
 users.
 The acceptance test

\end_inset

acts as a final verification of the required business functionality and
 proper functioning of the system, emulating real-world usage conditions
 on behalf of the paying client or a specific large customer.

\end_inset

 The test itself is

usually performed by clients or by end-users, do not normally focus on identifyi
ng simple problems such as spelling errors and cosmetic problems, nor showstoppe
r defects, such as software crashes; testers and developers previously identify
 and fix these issues during earlier unit testing, integration testing,
 and system testing phases.

We held our acceptance test during a meeting with both the customer and
 a small group of the intended users.
 We both showcased the product and offered them to use the product and provide
 feedback.
 Details from this meeting can be found in section INSERT SECTION HERE.

Sprint 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section the first sprint is described.
 First the planning and goals for the sprint, then the burndown chart is
 presented followed by the implementation.
 After that the occurring risks, then feedback from the customer, followed
 by an evaluation of the sprint.

\begin_layout Subsection
Sprint Planning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The duration of sprint 1 was from 18th of September to 1th of October.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During a large part of sprint 1, Marthe was away on a planned trip, so the
 group had to work while divided in two.
 To accommodate for this, Marthe had responsibility for gathering all the
 material that we currently had created in Google Drive, and put it together
 into a single LATEX document.
 In addition, she was to start looking into the test planning.
 The reason why we choose to move our report to a single LATEX document
 was that it allowed for better version control, as we put it together with
 our code on Github, and also to familiarize ourselves with LATEX, as it
 was very likely that the final report would be written in LATEX at the
 end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kristoffer and Stian, who were in Trondheim for the whole sprint, were going
 start on the implementation.
 To begin with, Stian would set up a raw skeleton for displaying the categories
 (hardcoded for now), while Kristoffer finnished a demo of the GUI, which
 would be shown to the customer and the supervisor.
 The next step was to display cases, along with their images and videos.
 All categories, cases, images and videos where to be either stored locally
 or hardcoded URL's to begin with, to focus only on the simple parts first.
 Before development could start, the iMac, borrowed from the customer, had
 to be set up with the required software and licenses.
 At that time the only software required was XCode and Titanium Studio.
 As Titanium was free to use, no license would be required at this step,
 but might be required if testing was to be done on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 device, and not the iPhone simulator which Titanium makes available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the team was quite inexperience with scrum, an additional feature
 was planned, that would be implemented if the initial tasks were completed
 within the first half of the sprint.
 That feature was loading the categories, cases, images and videos from
 the server.
 To allow for this, the server had to be set up with a MySQL server that
 stored the categories and cases, and a web server (Apache) that made available
 the images and videos.
 Setting up the server with the required software, and configuring it, was
 assigned to Stian, as he had some experience with it.
 Implementing the communication between the client (app) and the server,
 would be done in cooperation between Stian and Kristoffer, as they were
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

developers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for this sprint.
 In more detail, Stian would do the server side communication, and Stian
 and Kristoffer together would work on the client side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The customer provided us with images and videos form surgical operations,
 and a description of how all these could be categorized, so we were good
 to go with real case data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional goal of the sprint was to start working with Rally, to keep
 track of the backlog and the assigning of tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For sprint 1, we tried to complete two milestones, MP1, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Have a running prototype, able to show local photos, categorization of cases
 to enable browsing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and MP2, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Support for video, searching for cases, network support, server communication

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sprint goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of this sprint was to have a running prototype which could
 display categories and cases, and their images and videos.
 At that moment, only stored locally or hardcoded URL's.
 Another goal was to have an agreement with the customer for a rough GUI
 specification.
 Finally a goal for the report progress was to have a skeleton for the report
 in a LATEX document, with all written material previously written in Google
 Drive inserted.

System Burndown Chart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure below shows the burndown chart for this sprint.
 We managed to finish almost every task in this sprint, but we had both
 overestimated and underestimated the effort of time for many tasks.
 Therefore the ideal remaining effort line is slightly beneath the actual
 remaining effort line through most of this sprint.
 We did most of the work on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, which explain
 the horizontal line at day 1, day 2 , day 6 and day 7.We had to do a lot
 of programming in this sprint since our technical manager would be absent
 half of the next sprint, so a lot of work were planned in this sprint.

Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a description of everything that was implemented in this sprint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
User interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of the implementation for this sprint was to program the user interface
 for viewing categories and cases, and their images and videos.
 In the early phase of the sprint, we made a GUI demo with some options,
 which we intended to show to the customer.
 However, the customer was travelling for two and a half week, so no meeting
 with him was possible during sprint 1.
 The demo was therefore presented to him in an email, and he agreed with
 our design choices, and urged us on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first decision which had to be made, was to figure out how we 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

split
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the app into the three main 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that it should support, which was browsing categories, searching, and logging
 in.
 For this, we decided to use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tabs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one for each 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.

GUI demo: Browsing with tabs
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for why we chose to use tabs, were because of that it was the
 standard way to split a app into several functions, both for Android and
 iOS, and the customer had pointed out repeatedly that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

native look and feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was very important, and that he wanted an app that looked professional.
 Tabs was easily supported with Titanium, using a tab group that contains
 mutliple tabs (three in our case).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further on, we decided to simply use a list view to that simulates a tree
 structure to display the categories and the cases.
 To make the structure of the categories and cases as general as possible,
 a category could have zero or more sub-categories, and zero or more super-categ
ories, that was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parents
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Also, a category could have zero or more cases.
 Several categories could have the same case, and to decide which case that
 was shown when navigating the tree structure, we simply took the intersection
 of the cases for the categories we had selected.
 Below is a demo of the navigation:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a case was selcted, the case's images and videos would have to be displayed.
 To begin with, this was done be simply taking the user to a view of the
 first element (video or image), and from there, the user could swipe between
 images and videos belonging to the selected case.
 We had discussed the possibility for a thumbnails view or something similar
 also, but no decision about this had been made, and at this point we were
 postponing this until the customer could have his say on the matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Client-server communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Server side
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Titanium did not support direct communication with an external MySQL
 server, a dedicated component to compensate for this had be developed,
 and run on the server side.
 Since Titanium supported HTTP connections, a php script would run on the
 server's web server, and would be used to read data from the MySQL server,
 and send it to the client on request.
 In more detail, the server would answer a HTTP GET request, with a json
 list, which was built in the same way as the MySQL server, to ensure consistenc
y.
 The reason for sending json objects instead of for example XML objects,
 was that json objects typically were smaller, and faster to parse.
 Since the MySQL server only contained references to the images and videos,
 the data sent here would not be too large, and it would allow the client
 to stream the images and videos from the Apache web server, by sending
 the reference as URL's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Client side
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the application was booting up, the client would poll the server for
 data once, by sending an HTTP GET request, using Titanium's build-in support
 for this.
 The client would then receive the json list, which Titanium also had built-in
 support for parsing.
 Using this data, the app would build an internal structure of the categories
 in memory, and use this to generate the tree-structured navigation.
 The json object will also contain references to where the images and videos
 for each case can be streamed from, so these will also be stored locally.

\begin_layout Subsection
Customer Feedback
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the customer was away travelling during the whole sprint, all contact
 with him were done using emails.
 Prior to his travel, we decided that the sprint delivery, where the team
 showed what has been done this sprint, and would show a prototype to the
 customer if possible, were to be postponed until his arrival, somwhere
 in sprint 2.
 Thus, the only feedback from the customer during sprint 1 had been the
 feedback he gave on the GUI demo which were sent.
 His feedback regarding that, was that he very much liked the navigation,
 but he also wanted text on the back-button, explaining where it leads.
 This was exactly what the group intended, but that did not show very well
 on the demo.
 He also pointed out that categories would change, which will be fully supported
, by reading them from the SQL database.
 The categories in the demo were only examples.
 Other than these few comments, the customer agreed with our design choices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sprint Evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of the initial stories, viewing categories and cases,
 and their images and videos, went very well, and were done within the first
 half of the sprint.
 The team therefore moved on to set up MySQL server and Apache web server
 on the borrowed iMac, to use it for the development phase.
 This also went without too many quirks, even though the team was very unfamilia
r with Mac and OSX.
 Finally, the development of the client-server communication alos went well,
 considering no one on the group had touched php or Titanium before.
 As a note, the development team for the first sprint were not very comfortable
 with using Titanium and JavaScript at the start, but adapted to this by
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

learning by doing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The team was still not 100% that the right decision for development tools
 were chosen (Titanium vs Xamarin), as they felt they would be more productive
 writing code in C# than JavaScript, considering that JavaScript in theory
 does not support classes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We had some difficulties with Rally during this sprint.
 We managed to create the backlog and manage it from there, but we did not
 have alle the rights to add the data required to make a burndown chart.
 So we maintaind the backolg in Rally, but created the burndown chart in
 Exel.
 We continued to do this procedure in the next sprits as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The milestones MP1 and MP2 was completed within time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What went well during this sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The development phase turned out very good, given the odds.
 We had absolutely no experience with Titanium, JavaScript or Mac before
 the sprint.
 We also didn't have access to more than one Mac.
 Considering this we were very happy with how well the programming went.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We didn't have much progress on the report early in the sprint, but during
 the last week og the sprint, we really produced a lot of good content,
 which we were very happy with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What can be improved for the next sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We had a little slow start with the report writing this sprint, mainly because
 only the

\begin_layout Standard
The duration of sprint 2 was from the 2th of October to the 15th of October.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We almost managed to be done with every task from the previous sprint.
 There was only two tasks that had to be pushed to the backlog of sprint
 2, R1.8,

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our technical manager, Stian, was gone on a planned trip during half the
 sprint, and while he was there he worked on the report.
 Marthe and Kristoffer also foucused on the report, since there was to be
 a pre delivery on the 14th October, and we wanted to get as much feedback
 on the report as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We decided that there would not be implemented any new features in this
 sprint.
 This was because of the pre delivery of the report, and that Stian was
 gone most of the sprint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The customer came back from his trip the 9th October, which was in the midle
 of our sprint, and after that we agred that we would try to have regular
 meetings every second week.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For sprint 2, we planned to complete one milestone, MR2,

Sprint goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of the sprint was to have written as much as possible of the
 report.
 Since our technical manager was gone half the sprint, the report had our
 full attention.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the report, we wanted to be finnish writing the hole Part 1, and the
 chapters of Sprint 1.
 We also wanted to begin writing on the chapters of sprint 2.

Sprint backlog

\begin_layout Standard
The sprint backlog for this sprint is shown in the table below.
 It shows all the use case stories, with tasks and estimated effort that
 was planned for this sprint.
 We learned from the last sprint that we had underestimated the tasks, so
 we tried to give a better estimate this time.
 This sprint's backlog also contains the items that were pushed from sprint
 1.

The figure below shows the burndown chart for this sprint.
 We managed to finish almost every task in this sprint, and we had estimated
 the effort more realistic.
 The actual remaining effort line is beneath the ideal remaining effort
 line almost all the time through this sprint, which means that we have
 were not behind of schedule.
 We felt like we had a good progress with the work, but we did not implement
 anything this sprint, so the progress did not benefit the application.

We had a meeting with the customer on 9th October, and he did appore the
 progress so far.
 He had some comments on how the application would work on iPhone, in particular
ly zooming and tilting of images and videos.
 We agreed on the further work and the priority of the remaining tasks,
 as shown below with new priorities of the requirements.

\begin_layout Standard
We had a good progress with the report this sprint, we managed to write
 everything we had planned to the predelivery of the repot, so the milestone
 MR2 was completed within time.

What went well during this sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The progress on the report was very possitive.
 We managed to be finish with almost every tasks of this sprints backlog,
 and there were no hurry during this sprint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What can be improved for the next sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we were not a whole group the hole sprint, we planned for a bit too
 little work, and worked so after.
 In the next sprint we had to take this in mind when we were planning for
 sprint 3, so that we could complete the most important requirements from
 the customer

Sprint Planning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The duration of sprint 3 was from 16th of October to 29th of October.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We almost managed to be done with every task from the previous sprint, there
 was only one task that had to be pushed to the backlog of sprint 3, that
 was the R1.10, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Sprint 2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plan for sprint 3 was to pick up where we left off at sprint 1 on the
 development part.
 During a meeting with the customer in sprint 2, we received some feedback
 regarding the display of media files.
 The most important was that he wanted to be able to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tilt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the phone and have the image/video to rotate.
 He also wanted to be able to zoom using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pinching
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Finally he wanted us to separate the videos and images for a case into
 two categories, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

videos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

images
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and add some meta data.
 These things were to be implemented during sprint 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, we planned to implement separation of data with log in, so
 that registered users have access to all cases, while unregistered users
 only have access to public cases.
 We also planned to add functionality to search for cases using category
 keywords, for instance 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Primary Tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Finally we decided to start work on a standalone program that could aid
 the future administrator of the database to upload new items.
 We felt that the process of creating new cases and categories in the database
 was too complex and time-consuming to do manually.
 This, and the fact that a GUI for uploading was already requested by the
 customer, made us shift some resources towards this new program, which
 we will refer to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Admin tool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason why we set so ambitious goals regarding the amount of implementation
 for sprint 3 is that we laid a very thorough foundation in sprint 1, which
 made it quite easy to add new features, and that we did not have the time
 or opportunity to do any coding during sprint 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For sprint 3, we tried to complete milestone MP3,

 and also to have some progress on the functional requirements, by implementing
 separation.

The figure below shows the burndown chart for this sprint.
 We managed to finish every task in this sprint, and we felt that we had
 estimated the effort very realistic.
 We had a good progress with the work, but were slightly behind of schedule
 in the first week, but we managed to fetch up with the plan in the last
 week of the sprint.

\begin_layout Subsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a description of everything that was implemented in this sprint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Searching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Searching for cases was one of the customer's top requirements, and therefore
 the highest prioritized feature for sprint 3.
 It was implemented on a separate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tab
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Separation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Separation of data was one of the customer's requirements with high priority.
 The intention with it was not to provide air tight security for the private
 cases, but to only show a selection of cases to unregistered users.
 All cases were therefore left as they were on the web server, and also
 sent over to the phone on startup, but only cases marked as public would
 be displayed if not logged in.
 The reason why we decided to send all cases on startup, instead of only
 sending the public ones, were that we would have to send more cases after
 log in, and then rebuild all the menus.
 This would have caused additional loading time after logging in.
 Since security in itself was not a very high requirement by the customer,
 it was decided that loading all cases on startup was the best solution,
 prioritizing performance over security.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another much discussed point was the registering of new users.
 The customer had no intention of allowing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 users to register, so registering users using the admin panel (discussed
 in section 9.3.4) was deemed appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The log in process itslef was put on a separate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tab
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and consists of only fields for username and password, and also a log
 in button.
 After the user has logged in, this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tab
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 displays only a log out button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Viewing of media files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously mentioned, we received some feedback on the viewing of media
 files.
 We therefore implemented 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tilting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and zooming using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pinching
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Both were relatively straight forward, and required only a couple of code
 lines.
 Tilting was simply activated by setting a certain setting on the application
 windows that should be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tiltable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Zooming were implemented by putting all the media files inside a ScrollPane,
 which did all the zooming job for us.
 The only issue with this was that the view with the image was zoomed in
 by default when selecting a case.
 This was solved by finding the relation between the screen size (which
 can vary with different phone/pad models) and the original image size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition we split the media files into two categories, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

videos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

images
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which shows up when selecting a case.
 Also, on this new view where the user can choose between videos and images,
 we added a field for meta data.
 This field was split in two, after receiving feedback from the customer,
 to show only some metadata for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (not logged in) user, and extensive meta data for a registered user.
 This was implemented by splitting the column for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

description
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the SQL server into 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

publicDescription
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

privateDescrption
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and letting the user specify both when uploading a case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Admin tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned earlier, we realized that a small program, with the purpose
 of simplifying the upload process, was needed.
 We decided to write it in Java and make so that it would be executable
 on any machine and operating system.
 We also had libraries to support communication with our MySQL server availble
 for Java, finally we were all experience with Java as a programming language,
 so we were confident that we could complete it in reasonable time with
 the functionality that was needed.
 By writing a program to handle the uploads, many parts of the otherwise
 tedious insertions into the MySQL database could be automated.
 For example, to add a new case with Admin tool, the administrator can type
 in the name of the new case, the super- and subcategories it belongs to,
 the description and the path where the mediafiles are stored.
 The program will then create the new case with the description specified,
 create the categories if they do not already exist, add the proper relationship
 between the categories, add the case to the categories and finally add
 all the mediafiles with a pointer to the case.
 Manually this amounts to 40-50 insertions and 8-10 lookups in the database,
 with Admin tool it is all done automatically.
 Below is a sequence diagram that pictures the process of creating a new
 case and a new category in Admin tool.
 More detailed description of Admin tool will come in section INSERT SECTION

\begin_layout Subsection
Customer Feedback
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Halfway through the sprint, we had a meeting with the customer where we
 showed the progress so far.
 Here we showed that we had implemented zooming and tilting, as requested,
 and also splitted videos and images into two categories, and displaying
 meta data.
 The customer was very happy with the changes, but wanted the meta data
 to be split into two parts, one for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (not logged in) user, and one for the registered user.
 We told him that this would not be a problem, and promised to implement
 it this sprint, which we did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The customer was also very eager to see the application on a real device,
 not just the emulator, but as Marthe was traveling during sprint 3, and
 owned the team's only iDevice, this was not possible.
 We mentioned, however, that we had tested it on her phone, and that the
 videos were not running very smoothly when streaming over the internet.
 The main reason for this was that the videos had a very high resolution.
 The customer did not want to reduce this, so he suggested that we looked
 into the opportunity to download the videos to the device before playing
 it.
 As we were running out of time and approaching the delivery deadline, we
 made no promises regarding this, other than looking into it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the meeting the possibilities for demonstrating the application for
 some real users were discussed.
 As the application was close to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we had no objections to this, but the method for distributing the application
 to the test users was identified as an issue.
 Since Apple doesn't allow 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unfinished
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 applications on the App Store, alternative methods was to be researched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end of print 3, we had another meeting with the customer to show
 the progress of sprint 3, and to discuss the goals of sprint 4.
 The customer liked the idea of the admin tool for uploading new cases,
 registering new users, etc., but thought navigating through the menus was
 a little of a hazzle, and wanted the admin tool to be able to read information
 from a text file, and upload cases that way.
 Other than this, and a few bugs that the team already were aware of (see
 sprint 4 for details), he was happy with the application, and thought that
 no new features were necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sprint Evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The targeted milestone, MP3, was completed during sprint 3.
 Also, all new feature requests and tunings from the customer was implemented.
 So were all planned new features.
 We were very happy with this progress, and it actually put us up to speed
 with the schedule, even though we didn't do any programming in sprint 2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, the work items left over from sprint 2 was completed, like writing
 about sprint 2 in the report, etc.
 Some additional work were also done on the report, e.g.
 a lot of formating and set up of report structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What went well during this sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sprint 3 was very focused on the development part.
 We made very good progress, both on the mobile application itself, but
 also on the admin tool that we created.
 The mobile application was approaching a state where the team felt that
 all major requirements had been implemented, and only bug fixing and polishing
 remained.
 Considering that we decided to add a fourth sprint where some development
 also should take place, we were ahead of schedual with the development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What can be improved for the next sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During sprint 3, Marthe was the only person assigned to work with the report.
 Prior to sprint 3, we felt that we were ahead of schedual regarding the
 report, so we did not stress report writing that much.
 Marthe was, however, travelling a whole week, and was also sick a couple
 of days, so the report saw minimal progress.
 This might have been a mistake, and one more person should perhaps have
 used for example half the sprint to write on the report, to not fall too
 far behind.
 This means that for sprint 4, the final sprint, we might have to down prioritiz
e bug fixing, and instead focus solely on the report.

In addition, we wanted to implement the admin tool's new feature, suggested
 by the customer at the end of sprint 3, to be able to read information
 from a text file to upload new cases.
 It was also requested that we update the database with new cases and a
 new category hierarchy specified by the customer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the customer wanted us to show the mobile application to some co-worker
s of the customer.
 These users were right in the middle of the target user group.
 To be able to do this, we had to find a way to distribute the application
 without the need of connecting all the devices to a Mac.

Also, we planned to pick up on the report, and really get some progress
 going there, by writing what remained about the sprints, conclusion, and

The figure below shows the burndown chart for this sprint.
 We managed to finish every task in this sprint, and we felt that we had
 estimated the effort very realistic.
 We had a good progress with the work, and in the end of the sprint we managed
 to work in accordance with ideal burndown.
 We did work almost every day in this sprint, as can be seen in the almost
 linear line for the actual remaining effort.

\begin_layout Subsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a description of everything that was implemented in this sprint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bug fixing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bug #1 was a result of long loading time when opening many images at once,
 with a slow internet conneciton.
 When an iOS application does not repsond withing 10 seconds or so, it is
 killed by the operating system.
 As we saw it, we had two possible solutions for this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Implement some sort of caching or buffering of images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduce the number of images for some large cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As were concluded at the meeting with the surgeons, a case should not contain
 that many images, to not make a case too messy.
 Option 2 was therefore a very tempting solution, but perhaps not very pretty.
 We therefore implemented a very simple form for caching, where the last
 opened case always was cached locally, to reduce loading time, and the
 chance for the application to be killed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bug #4 was quite hard to replicate.
 It seemed that when opening a the images of a case for the first time ever
 (after installing the application, not after restart), the image was zoomed
 in, without the possibility to zoom out.
 Since the images had a very high resolution, they had to be scaled down
 a little before being displayed.
 This usually worked as expected, but not the very first time.
 This was solved by caching the image locally, and then calculating the
 size and the zoom, not doing it on the fly as before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bug #7 was reduced by implementing local caching, but was not fully fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bug #8 was not really a software bug, but miscommunication with the customer
 when entering categories into the database.
 This was fixed very easily by altering the database content slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team were not able to fix the remaining bugs in sprint 4 due to lack
 of time.
\end_layout

Admin tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Making the admin tool read from a text file and create cases using the informati
on there, was implemented simply by creating a thin layer over the admin
 tool.
 This layer simply read from a file, converts the information there into
 the commands that the admin tool expects, and runs the admin tool.
 The format of the input text file must be like this:

\begin_layout Standard
To distribute the mobile application without using a Mac, we used a web
 service called Test Flight

, which let us upload a mobile application build to the web, add the UDID's
 of the devices that should have access, and then download the application
 from the web, using a mobile phone.

Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During sprint 4 we redid all our previous system test in order to prepare
 for the acceptance test and meeting with the customer and future users.
 Since we also updated our database to the new desired structure, the tests
 became slightly different.
 See appendix C.2 for a overview of the data we used during testing.

Customer Feedback
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feedback from the customer after sprint 4 was very positive.
 He was very happy with how many features we had implemented, and how they
 looked.
 He did, of course, not like that the application was not completely free
 of bugs, so we promised to look at them if we could make time for it.
 Other than that, he thought the application was a good foundation to build
 on top of, and even asked if we wanted to continue with the project when
 writing our master.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sprint Evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The milestone MP4 was not completed within time.
 We did not prioritize caching of data, as we, in accordance with the customer,
 found other things more important.
 Some minor bugs was also not fixed due to lack of time.
 The admin tool was completed during sprint 4, which should be very useful
 for the customer.
 It makes him able to upload new cases without any knowledge of databases
 or SQL at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All in all we were very happy with the progress of sprint 4.
 The admin tool turned out very good, and we had a very useful meeting with
 the customer and his co-workers.
 The application at its current state was deemed finished, and most requirements
 were complete.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What went well during this sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ahead of the meeting with the surgeons, where we were to present the application
 and do a little demo, we discovered quite a lot of bugs, in cooperation
 with the customer.
 This was late the night before the presentation, so we didn't have many
 hours to fix or hide them.
 Even though, we were able to fix a lot of major bugs in the very short
 time before the presentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were also very happy with the meeting with the surgeons itself.
 It was very good for us to see that what we were doing actually was important
 for someone, and that they was very interesting.
 In addition, it was nice to get feedback from more than only the customer,
 both on what we had so far, but also on features they wanted, and such.
 The surgeons even started discussions amongst them on what features they
 thought would be nice to have, and that was very interesting for us to
 listen in on, even if we didn't have time to implement any more features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What can be improved for the next sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sprint 4 was the last sprint, but we discovered several things that could
 have been improved for potential future sprints.
 These are discussed here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of time in sprint 4 was used to prepare the meeting with the surgeons.
 Both on finding a way to distribute the application, and on planning what
 to do and what to say.
 Also, a quite some time was spent coordinating the meeting with the customer.
 The meeting also took a large part of one day.
 When estimating tasks for sprint 4, we did not plan to use this much time
 on the meeting and its preparations.
 That might have been a little mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the time spent on the meeting, resulted in that fewer than planned bugs
 were fixed, and also that the report saw less progress than ideal.
 This will likely result in some overtime in the last couple of weeks of
 the project.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Final System Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The architecture was made at the beginning of the process and has been followed
 pretty closely throughout the implementation.
 However, there have been some changes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since JavaScript/Titanium didn't really support classes, the class diagram
 in figure 6.3 was merely used as a starting point.
 Using JavaScript, we was, however, able to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

simulate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 classes, by using functions with attributes and functions.
 This way, we were able to implement a class-like architecture for the Category,
 Case, and MediaFile classes in the class diagram.
 LoginHandler and DatabaseHandler was not implemented using such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, since there are no relations for them.
 They are simply ordinary functions.
 Some changes were also done to the attributes of the three classes to reflect
 the changes in the database.
 See below.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The database architecture was also altered slightly.
 The description field of MediaFile was moved to Case, and split into two
 new fields, privateDescription and publicDescription.
 This was done to better accomodate what the customer wanted.
 A new field was also added to MediaFile, called video.
 This is a simple boolean (true/false) field that explains if the given
 MediaFile is a video or not.
 If video is false, the MediaFile must be an image.
 The video field was added to simplify the support for multiple video formats.
 With this solution, the application itslef doesn't need to be changed at
 all to support new video formats, as long as the underlying framework (Titanium
 and iOS) supports them.
 Other than these minor changes, the database was implemented as originally
 designed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overall architecture, as seen in figure 6.2, was followed without any
 modifications, and will therefore not be discussed in this section.
 See chapter 6 for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the implementation of GUI with MVC, it showed to be a little harder
 to do with Titanium and JavaScript, since no classes exists.
 In addition, the creation of GUI elements in Titanium is a little awkward.
 To try to still follow the MVC pattern, we decided to create own functions
 to display categories and cases with.
 These functions in practice make out the View part of MVC.
 We also created specific Controller functions to respond to any user interactio
n with the GUI.
 The model part, however, were a little more challenging.
 To keep the state of the browsing we created a global variable to hold
 this information.
 In a more object-oriented language, we would have used a dedicated class
 for this, but this did not feel very natural with Titanium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Project Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, the system, as it was at the end of the project, will be
 described in depth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system consists of several parts, where the main part is the mobile
 application.
 In addition, some server software was created, and also a simple command-line
 based admin tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application itslef is divided into three tabs, which represents the
 application's three main functions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Browsing, where the user can browse categories and cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Searching, where the user can search for specific cases using categories
 as keywords
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Login, where the user can enter login information to log in, to be able
 to view private cases, and private descriptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Browse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab is the application's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab, and where users probably will spend the most time.
 The navigation is structured as a hierarchy, where selecting a category
 will display all its sub-categories.
 Selecting a category which has no sub-categories, will display all cases
 that belongs to all the categories selected on the current 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The user can also select 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Show all
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at any point in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to view all cases belonging to the categories on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so far.
 A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a set of the categories which has been selected by the user.
 For instance, if the user selects 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and then 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Primary tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the path will look like this: Tumor -> Primary tumor.
 Selecting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Show all
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with this path will display only cases which belong to both 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Primary tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 tab is another alternative to find cases.
 The first window consists simply of a help label, explaining the allowed

 and a search button.
 Completing the search, by either clicking the search button or by tapping
 search on the keyboard (which is displayed when selecing the text area),
 the user is taken to a search results window.
 This window will display cases that matches the search keywords.
 Selecting a case will take the user to the same case view as when browsing.

 Below, up to two choices are available, videos and images.
 These are only shown if they contain anything, for example, if the selected
 case only contains images, the video choice is not displayed, and vice

The server
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The server software contains of two different PHP scripts which runs ontop
 of pre-existing software.
 The two PHP scripts is simply to load all categories and cases from the
 database, and to verify if user login information is corrrect.
 These runs ontop of Apache with PHP support.
 Apache is also used to make the media files available on the Internet.
 The server also run a MySQL instance, which is the database used to store
 the cases, categories, media file references, and user information.

The admin tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The admin tool was created to simplify the process of uploading new cases
 and registering users, without the need for any database or SQL knowledge.
 It is purely command-line based, and can be used in two ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The program can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

started
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and used in an interactive way where you select choices from a menu, and
 then follows the instructions, step-by-step to create a case and upload
 data, or create a new user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The program can also be run with a file path as argument.
 If this file follows a specified format, it can be used to upload a new
 case, without the need of navigating menus and such.

Further Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application project for this group was never supposed to be a standalone
 application, but a foundation for a more entertaining application.
 The goal was to create an application which were able to read data from
 a server, and display it in an intuitive way.
 Therefore it is obviously a lot of work left to do with the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Unfinished requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all of the requirements that was established with the customer was finished
 either, and we created more requirements than we thought would be manageabe,
 so this was not a surprise.
 The reason why we did that was that we wanted a more complete picture of
 what the customer wanted, so that we could atleast lay the foundation for
 it, if not able to implement it all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The requirements regarding local storage/caching, FR07 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Save images to phone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and FR08 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Save video to phone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was not implemented at all.
 These requirements were downgraded in priority by the customer, when it
 became clear that we were not able to fulfill all requirements.
 This was done because it doesn't really give anything new to the application,
 but makes it usable without an Internet connection.
 A function to download files were, however, implemented as a foundation
 for these, so the requriements should be quite simple for further development.

 were fulfilled in accordance with the customer, but no GUI were created
 for them.
 This was to save time, and was actually the customer's idea, since he thought
 it would be sufficient with a command line based tool to do these things,
 for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final requirements, FR11

, were not something the group and the customer expected to be completed
 during this project, and they were not.
 These are two of the major requirements for further development.

An overview of the total progress of the requirements can be seen in the

Other functionality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the functionality that we were not finished with, there is
 many other features that could be developed to improove the system:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Take notes to an image - Any user could take notes for them selves to an
 image and store it localy.
 They could draw lines and write down their own thoughts and descriptions.
 This could be helpful for own learning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For each image there could be an indication showing in wich location of
 the brain the image was taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There could be a list showing all the images belonging to a case in miniature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There could be possible to publish articles in the application so users
 could learn more about ultrasound.
 It could be used to give advise about how to use ultrasound imaging during
 an operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There could be possible to refer to or give links to other sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section the evaluation of the group, project and technology are
 given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Process evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the members in the group and the customer spoke Norwegian, so there
 was never any difficulty understanding each other.
 Our supervisor spoke English, but we did not felt like there was any huge
 language barrier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We had a good group dynamic through the project.
 We did not have any major disagreements, but if there were any, we confronted
 each other and solved it quickly.
 We had agreed to communicate through certain channels, and we managed to
 be available almost all the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The customer was available by mail, and we could always reach him by that.
 We met him about every other week, but sometimes he was absent on different
 journeys.
 He always informed us of the trips, so we could plan with that in mind.
 The feedback we got from the customer after meetings, and especially after
 our demonstrations of our product, was very beneficial and helped us stay
 on the right track.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main communication channel with the supervisor was mail and our regular
 meeting.
 We prepared for these meetings with questions, a status on the feedback
 from the customer and the most recent version of our report and product.
 The supervisor was also gone on a few journeys, but we could reach him
 by mail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Roles and group work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being only three people on a project that, to us, seemed intended for 5-6
 people was daunting at the start of the project.
 Due to a misestimation our (and other) group ended up being about half
 the intended size.
 After a discussion with the course responsibles we accepted the fact that
 we would have to complete the course with only thee members and tried to
 work around it.
 Wheather or not the customers were informed of the smaller group size but
 an unfortunate consequence of this was that we simply had too little manhours
 to complete all the features the customer wanted in the project.
 We not only had less people to develop the application, but also less people
 to write the report wich is a quite substantial part of the project and
 does require a lot of time.
 Despite the smaller workforce we got off to a good start as all members
 were motivated to do a good job and we all shared a similar goal and agreed
 on the amount of work to put into the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Roles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We specified, in the planning chapter, different roles for the the three
 member of the group, with different responsabilities and tasks.
 We quickly realized however that with such a small group the tasks and
 responsibilities would be very floating and vary from day to day.
 I light of this, we still tried to keep our role assignments as a general
 guideline, but we decided to not take our roles too literally and rather
 just communicate frequently about what we were doing and who was responsible
 for what.
 In retrospect we believe that this cause us to be more efficient and spend
 less time on delegating work and coordinating our efforts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Actual time used
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We planned to use a total of 1050 person-hours during this project, spead
 out over 14 weeks and three people.
 We tracked our time used on the different parts of the project in addition
 to our work on the product backlog.

 abit above of the estimated time, with the biggest difference being the
 report taking more time then expected.
 The following figure shows our activity on Github, which isnt a one-to-one
 relationship with time spent, but does give an idea of how the intensity
 of our work progressed throughout the project.
 The graph shows the amount of commits to master distributed over time.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the late parts of the project we had to work overtime to get all
 our tasks done, this was not very unexpected and we feel that our estimation
 was reasonably good.
 We feel however that the course recommandation of 25 hours of work per
 week might have been abit high as it somewhat affected the amount of time
 the groupmembers had left for other work and extracurricular activities.
 (Maybe in personal evaluation) REMOVE THIS AFTER.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the risk evaluation, we did not predict that we would use three weeks
 of deciding platform, neither that we were to be driven away from our office
 due to construction noise.
 We had to leave the iMac in the office and use TeamViewer to communicate
 with it when we sat in another place.
 There were more sickness among the group members than predicted, but we
 did not lose that much time due to that, since we had planned with buffer,
 and the group members could work other days and in the evenings.
 The planned absent of the group member did not cause that much problem,
 since it was informed in good time before, so we could plan with that in
 mind.
 Most of the action taken was that the group member that was gone, would
 do the work before he or she returned.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Prestudy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the terms of the customer, mainly the prerequisite of multiplatform
 possibilities and the preferance towards Titanium as the development tool,
 we had a hard time finding similar or usable code for our project.
 If we had the opportunity to develop for a single platform it would have
 been easier to find reusable code, but given our circumstance we weren't
 able to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scrum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision to use the Scrum method was evaluated as good.
 Some from our group had an experience with scrum from other projects, so
 the particular scrum artefacts were known.
 The process of learning scrum went quite well, but we did not follow everything
 as strict as we first predicted.
 For example, we had more of a daily sit down, than a daily stand up.
 We managed to keep the meeting short, and the topics were the same as described
 in daily stand up meetings.
 The Sprint planning meetings where held the same day as the sprint evaluation,
 due to the customer had more available time when our sprint started.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the project evolved, we were more pleased with the choice of the lifecycle.
 The fact that sprint 2 should not contain any programming, did we not know
 at the start.
 And that the time required to get the necessary hardware, were not known,
 we only sat a deadline for that.
 The time for deciding the development platform, were also not predicted
 to take three weeks.
 So the uncertainties in the project were very well covered by scrum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We maintained the burndown chart for each sprints backlog in a common document,
 as we had a problem with rally.
 We logged the time used for the tasks in the backlog, and continuously
 saw how the progress was going.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used pair programming half the time we programmed.
 It was helpful, and we learned more from each other than we would if we
 did not do it.
 It came quite naturally, and it was more efficient that one wrote code
 and the other could watch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the planning phase it got quite obvious that the customer had created
 the project with more than three people over three months in his mind.
 The customer was, however, very accomodating and realistic when confronted
 with the small group size, and we agreed on what was realistic to do.
 Since the deadline for registering for the course was well into the project,
 our supervisor told us that we might get one additional group member if
 we were a little lucky.
 We therefore decided to keep a couple of, perhaps, unrealistic requirements
 for a group of three, like FR11, FR12, and FR13, but we gave them a very
 low priority.
 It was also useful for us to have the extra future requirements when creating
 the general foundation for the app, as previously discussed.
 It let us see what should be supported without too many changes.
 We therefore do not see it as a failure that these requirements were not
 completed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Architechture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the customer came to us late in sprint 4 and wanted some changes in
 the category structure, we were very happy that we created the database
 as flexible as we did.
 The changes required no recompilation, and they were completed with only
 a couple of SQL operations in very short time.
 In the end, we felt very successful with our data structure, and how general
 we made it.
 With our desing, the customer can add as many structures and sub-structures
 of categories and cases as he wants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The few small changes we did with our architecture, as discussed in 12.1
 (DOBBELTSJEKK) Final System Architecture, was to acommodate more specific
 requirements from the customer, and to simplify som implementation details.
 All in all, we followed to initial architecture very closely, and were
 happy with it.
 It also allows the web server and the database server to be set up on the
 same computer, or separated on several, as the workload changes.
 This gives the system very good scalability, to allow many users to connect
 at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When developing the graphical user interface (GUI) for the mobile application,
 we decided to follow the model view controller (MVC) software architecture
 pattern, as discussed in chapter 6.5.
 It showed, however, that this was not a very simple task with Titanium
 and JavaScript.
 We ended up with a variation of MVC, as discussed in 12.1 Final System Architect
ure, where the three components were separated by functions, but not by
 classes or files.
 We were not entirely happy with this, but was as good as we were able to
 do it.
 The consequence of this is that the code is perhaps not as readable as
 it could have been.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in chapter 7 about testing, our limited time and resources
 made us shorten the amount of pre-written tests and focus more on unit-
 and integrationtesting as an integrated part of the programming.
 This worked well for us and saved us several hours of planning and testing
 throughout the project.
 The amount of bugs at any time during the implementation was always manageble
 and the final polish and debugging part of application went throught with
 less difficulty then expected.
 We credit this to the thourough unit- and integrationtesting during all
 parts of the development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We decided against having a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 useability test.
 The technicians and escpecially the surgeons were very busy, and their
 time is very precious (they save lifes!), so one should have an extremely
 good reason to take up their time.
 In addition, the application is not a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

final product
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but only an application which provides base functionality to be built
 upon.
 To compensate for this we had good contact with the customer throughout
 the whole project, who we asked for feedback on the app.
 During the meeting with the suregons, everybody had the opportunity to
 test the app, so we received a lot of good feedback there as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Project Evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Evaluation criteria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in the introduction, the goal of the project was to create
 an application for our customer that can be used for proof-of-concept and
 further development.
 The evaluation criteria was therefore primary how satisfied the customer
 was with our end product and how well it fit and satisfied the requirements
 we created together.
 The possibility for implementation of additional features in the future
 and a general expansion of the application was also an important criteria.
 In order for the application to function as a proof-of-concept we figured
 that it would have to be, on some level, useful for the intended users
 when we were done with the prototype.
 In order to test this we would have to meet with some of the potentional
 users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Final meeting with the customers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meeting with the surgeons took place at St.
 Olavs Hospital at the 8th of November.
 Our meeting with the surgeons was the first part of an internal weekly
 meeting for their team.
 Present at the meeting was 2 surgeons, 3 technicians, the customer, and
 the three group members.
 The reason for the meeting was that we wanted to receive feedback on the
 project from additional potential users than only our customer.
 We wanted feedback both on what they thought about the current application
 that was demoed, and also on what potential uses they saw for the app,
 as well as potential future features.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meeting was diveded into two parts.
 The first part was used to show a demo of the application on a large screen.
 The demo consisted of showing all the features, and passing an iPhone,
 with the app installed, around the room, for all the participants to try.
 The demo started with regular browsing through categories, which ended
 up in a case where both video, streamed directly from a server, and images
 from an operation was shown.
 Second, we logged on as a registered user with the application, to show
 the differences.
 These differences included additional meta data for all cases, as well
 as som complete cases that only were shown after logging in.
 Finally, the search function was briefly demoed, by searching for a keyword,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tumor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and then browsing through the cases that matched the keyword.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second part of our meeting with the suregons was a discussion, where
 the surgeons and technicians explained what they thought about the application
 which was demoed, and which they had been able to test themselves on the
 iPhone that was passed around the room.
 They also came up with a lot of possible additional features, which they
 thought would be useful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the meeting, the surgeons found one bug, the bug where the application
 crashed when displaying the images of a case with many images.
 Other than this, they had no negative comments on the current state of
 the application, and they seemed very happy with it.
 They thought that the application, at its current state, could already
 be useful, and they thought that the basic functionality provided by the
 application was very good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meeting attendants had a lot of suggestions for additional features,
 as summarized in the table below.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Evaluation of the project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project evaluation is largely based on feedback from the customer, and
 from the surgeons that we presented the application for, and how their
 feedback compare to the evaluation criteria.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application itself was not 100% 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when presented to the customer and his co-workers, the surgeons, and this
 was obviously something that should have been fixed.
 The bugs, however, were not in the foundation part of the application,
 only in the presentation part, so they were not very critical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the presentation, we received very positive feedback on the features
 implemented so far, and they were very impressed with what we had been
 able to do with so short time, and with the possibilities that the foundation
 provided.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a proof-of-concept, the application worked very well.
 We were able to demonstrate many features, like browsing categories, viewing
 case images and video, searching for cases, separation of data for registered
 and non-registered users.
 The test users decided that the application, at its current level (minus
 the bugs), would be very useful without further development, and they inquired
 both on how possible it would be to publish the application on the App
 Store, but also on how the process of adding new cases worked.
 This was very positive feedback, and all in all, we concluded that the
 customer was happy with the product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we were aware of the fact that our application was to be used as a
 foundation for a future, we had this in the back of our head throughout
 the whole implementation process.
 This is not a part that the customer and the surgeons have any insight
 in, but we think that we did a good job of making our code as flexible
 as possible, allowing new features.
 The methods to retrieve data internal in the app is also very straight
 forward.

\begin_layout Subsection
Technology Evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section some of the technologies used during the project is discussed.
 The technologies evaluated are those that actually had an impact on the
 project work, both positive and negative.
 All technologies was discussed in the tools and technology section, so
 the others are not evaluated here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Apple, iOS and Mac
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early phase of the project we spent a lot of time discussing which
 platforms the application should support, and which frameworks would fit
 the project.
 The customer was very certain that iOS should be the main platform, but
 the team did not have a single Mac among them.
 Since Mac is required to develop and test an application for iOS, a solution
 had to be worked out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a couple of weeks, the customer was able to supply us with an iMac
 that we could borrow.
 This made us able to target the iOS platform, but only one person was able
 to write code and test it at once.
 This increased the development time by two thirds, and was a restriction
 from Apple that felt very unecessary.
 In addition, to run the application on an actual device an Apple developer
 license was required.
 The customer already had one of these, but it was also being used by another
 developer at the time.
 The fact that it was already in use, limited us to quite some extent.
 We were dependent on receiving a private encryption key from the other
 developer, which took almost a month.
 This limitation delayed the testing on an actual device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Titanium and JavaScript
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first glance, Titanium with JavaScript seemed like a very nice tool to
 develop a cross-platform application for mobile devices, since it compiles
 down to native code, and that almost all of the GUI code can be used for
 multiple platforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Titanium and JavaScript showed, however, to be a bit of a pain to work with.
 First of all, all the team members were very unfamiliar with JavaScript.
 This is a major point, and we spent quite some time learning and getting
 familiar with JavaScript, before we started to be productive.
 In addition, JavaScript does not have direct support for classes, and even
 though its name is very similar to Java, the two languages does not look
 very much alike at all.
 We were also in for a surprise when it came to Titanium's development environme
nt.
 Titanium studio is a free IDE built on top of Eclipse, and which also allows
 the developer to test the application on an iOS simulator.
 It has, however, a couple of flaws.
 First, and perhaps most important, is its total lack of useful debugging
 support.
 When running an app on the iOS simulator through Titanium studio, the error
 codes that pop up does not make sense at all, and the line numbers is typically
 way off .
 In addition, Auto-completion when writing code is almost non-existant,
 and only work in the simplest cases.
 These major shortcomings results in additionally extended development time,
 but also, and perhaps more important, a much longer testing and debugging
 phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Eclipse and Java
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After developing with Titanium and JavaScript for several weeks, developing
 the admin tool in Java with ordinary Eclipse was a actually quite a pleasure.
 It made us appreciate the complete auto-completion of code, and that error
 messages and exceptions actually tells the programmer where and what actually
 went wrong.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team was very happy with the product.
 The application turned very nice, and received very good feedback from
 both the customer, and also some potential users, the surgeons.
 Even though we were not able to implement all the features that the customer
 initially wanted, we got very far on the prototype, considering the small
 group size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The server software that we implemented worked very well.
 The admin tool that was created to simplify upload of new data, and registering
 of users, was only command line based, but this was the customter's own
 suggestion, so we were happy with that one also.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we were also happy with the team work, and the communication with
 the customer, and the supervisor.
 The team met at least three days a week to work for several hours, and
 we usually made good progress.
 Even if somebody was not able to meet, we divided tasks well, to keep all
 team members busy doing something useful.
 The team also had meetings with the supervisor almost every week, and got
 a lot of useful feedback from him, both on the product and on the report.
 The meetings with the customer was usually at the end of each sprint, or
 when either we, or the customer, felt the need for a meeting.
 These meetings usually consisted of showing the customer the product's
 state, and getting feedback on it.
 In addition, the plan for the next sprint was usually revised to accomodate
 the customer's wishes.
 These meetings were very useful, both to see if we were on the right track,
 but also to see if the customer's priority of new features had changed.

\end_inset

tabs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which provides the three main functions of the application.
 These tabs can be switched between by selecting their respective titles
 at the bottom of the application.

Admin Tool User Manual

\begin_layout Standard
The admin tool can only be run localy from the server which runs the database.
 To do this, SSH 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ssh"

\end_inset

 is the preferred method.
 Connecting to the server can be done from a UNIX (Mac, Linux, etc.) terminal
 by typing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ssh [user name]@[server IP address]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The admin tool can then be launched by typing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

java -jar Admintool.jar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the directory where it is located.
 This is by default in the home directory, so no directory changing is needed.
 To make the admin tool run commands from a text file (described below),
 simply run 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

java -jar Admintool.jar [path to text file]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To upload media files when creating a new case, the files must be stored
 on the server, and they must be located so that the Apache web server is
 able to locate them, e.g.
 in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/Library/WebServer/Documents/media/[casename]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Based on testing we did, we recommend movies to be uploaded in the .mp4
 format with a resolution of 960x540, framerate of 29-30 fps and a total
 bitrate of 1500-2000 bbps.
 Images must be of the .jpeg filetype, the best resolution is 1919x1153 pixels.

Additional Tools

\begin_layout Standard
Admin tool will only assist in updating and maintaining the database, it
 is still necessary to communicate with the database directly for several
 different actions, such as deleting or modifying data.
 In order to do this the administrator needs either to use standard SQL
 queries directly to the database server, or a 3rd party database management
 program can be utilized.
 We found the MySQL Workbench
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "workbench"

\end_inset

 to cover all the necessary features, so we would recommend that in addition
 to our own Admin tool to maintain and expand the database.
